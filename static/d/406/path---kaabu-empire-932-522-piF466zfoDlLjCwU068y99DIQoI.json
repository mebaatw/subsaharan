{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The Kaabu Empire (1537–1867), also written Gabu, Ngabou, and N’Gabu', was a Mandinka empire of Senegambia centered within modern northeastern Guinea-Bissau, Larger parts of today's Gambia; Kingdom of Saloum, extending into Koussanar, Koumpentoum regions of South Eastern Senegal, and Casamance in Senegal. It rose to prominence in the region thanks to its origins as a former imperial military province of the Mali Empire. After the decline of the Mali Empire, Kaabu became an independent Empire. It's government was militaristic. The ruling class was composed of warrior-elites made rich by slaves captured in war. </p>\n<p>Mandinka oral tradition holds that Kaabu was the actual birthplace of the Mande musical instrument, known as the Kora. A kora is built from a large calabash cut in half and covered with cow skin to make a resonator, and has a notched bridge like a lute or guitar. The Kora was traditionally used by the griots as a tool for preserving history, ancient tradition, to memorize the genealogies of patron families and sing their praises, to act as conflict intermediaries between families, and to entertain.</p>\n<p>Kansala, the imperial capital of Kaabu Empire was annexed by Futa Jallon during the 19th century Fula jihads. However, Kaabu's vast independent Kingdoms across SeneGambia regions continued to thrive even after the fall of Kansala; until total incorporation of the remaining Kingdoms into the British Gambia, Portuguese and French spheres of influence during the Scramble for Africa.</p>\n<p>Read more: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaabu\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaabu</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"kaabu-empire"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kaabu Empire","img":[{"name":"kaabu-empire_Kora.jpg","desc":"The kora is a 21-string bridge-harp used extensively in West Africa"},{"name":"kaabu-empire_Gravikord.jpg","desc":"Signature Series Gravikord"},{"name":"kaabu-empire_TrebleKalimba.jpg","desc":"A Hugh Tracey treble Kalimba."},{"name":"","desc":""},{"name":"","desc":""},{"name":"","desc":""},{"name":"","desc":""}],"vid":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_6zPe0nAo4"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9fDwtm2g0oM"}],"url":[{"id":1,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kora_(instrument)","title":"Kora (instrument)","desc":"A kora is a Mandinka harp built from a large calabash cut in half and covered with cow skin to make a resonator with a long hardwood neck.
