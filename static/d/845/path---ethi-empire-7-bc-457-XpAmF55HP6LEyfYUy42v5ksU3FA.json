The eponymously named Solomonic dynasty was founded and ruled by the Abyssinians, from whom Abyssinia gets its name. The Abyssinians reigned with only a few interruptions from 1270  until 1974, which ended by a coup d'état and deposition of the emperor Haile Selassie. This dynasty governed large parts of Ethiopia through much of its modern history. During this time, the empire conquered and annexed various kingdoms into its realm. The dynasty also successfully fought off Italian, Ottoman and Egyptian forces and made fruitful contacts with some European powers.</p>","fields":{"slug":"ethi-empire"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ethiopian Empire: The Solomonic Dynasty","img":[{"name":"","desc":""},{"name":"ethi-empire_Hand_Cross.jpg","desc":"13th century Solomonic hand cross."},{"name":"ethi-empire_Yekuno_Amlak.jpg","desc":"Yekuno Amlak, became king of kings of Ethiopia following the defeat of the last Zagwe king."},{"name":"ethi-empire_BlackSheba-Text.jpg","desc":"he Queen of Sheba, from a 15th-century manuscript now at Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Göttingen"},{"name":"ethi-empire_Bibelfenster85.jpg","desc":""},{"name":"ethi-empire_Emperor_Menelik_II.png","desc":"Menelik II, Emperor of Ethiopia"},{"name":"ethi-empire_empress_zauditu.jpg","desc":"Zewditu, Empress of Ethiopia"},{"name":"ethi-empire_Zewditu_and_priest.png","desc":"Empress Zewditu with one of her favored priests"},{"name":"ethi-empire_Haile_Selassies.jpg","desc":"Haile Selassie, Emperor of Ethiopia, in full dress c. 1960"},{"name":"ethi-empire_Fasilides_Palace_02.jpg","desc":"Fasilides Palace in the Fasil Ghebbi, Gondar, Ethiopia"},{"name":"ethi-empire_Sebara_Dildiy.jpg","desc":"Sebara Dildiy (broken bridge in Amharic) was one of two stone bridges built over the Blue Nile River during Fasilides reign.

During the Era of the Princes, Shewa was, even more than most provinces, an independent entity, its ruler even styling himself Negus, a royal title denoting monarchy. In the course of subduing the Shewans, Tewodros imprisoned a Shewan prince, Menelik II, who would later become emperor himself.
