{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The Sultanate or Kingdom of Bagirmi or Baghermi (French: Royaume du Baguirmi) was a kingdom and Islamic sultanate southeast of Lake Chad in central Africa. It was founded in either 1480 or 1522 and lasted until 1897, when it became a French protectorate. Its capital was Massenya, north of the Chari River and close to the border to modern Cameroon. The kings wore the title Mbang.</p>\n<p>The Bagirmi carried a tradition that they migrated from far to the east, which is supported by the resemblance of their language to various tribes on the White Nile. It is not entirely clear when and by whom Bagirimi kingdom was founded: some king lists trace this event to 1480, when it was supposedly founded by Mbang Abd al-Mahmud Begli, while others deem Mbang Birni Besse responsible, who is said to have founded the kingdom in 1522. He seems to have displaced the earlier Bulala, while he also began to build a palace in Massenya, the capital of the state. The fourth king, Abdullah (1568â€“1608), adopted Islam and converted the state into a sultanate, permitting the state to extend their authority over many pagan tribes in the area, including the area's Saras, Gaberi, Somrai, Gulla, Nduka, Nuba, and Sokoro. He and his successors continued to use the title \"mbang\" alongside that of \"sultan\".</p>\n<p>The Shari River formed the kingdom's western boundary, with most of its interior watered by its affluents. The area was home to a kind of footworm that mutilated many of the inhabitants. Bagirmi was also continually plagued by drought, pestilence, and slave raiding both internally and externally organized. During the reign of Idris Alooma Bornu conquered Bagirmi. The Muslim Bagirmi would raid the pagan tribes of their own kingdom in order to pay the necessary tribute to Bornu. Except of slaves, including eunuchs, Bagirmi also exported animal skins, ivory and cotton, while importing copper and cowrie shells. Trade with Bornu was carried out by caravans along a route which extended north across the Sahara to Tripoli on the Libyan coast. During the reign of Mbang Muhammad al-Amin (r. 1751-1785) Bagirmi became independent again, although the tributary status remained.</p>\n<p>Early in the 19th century, Bagirmi fell into decay and was threatened by the Sultanate of Wadai. It was finally annexed in 1871.</p>\n<p>Read more:\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultanate_of_Bagirmi\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultanate<em>of</em>Bagirmi</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"bagirmi"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kingdom of Bagirmi","img":[{"name":"bagirmi_Bagirmi.jpg","desc":"\"Horseman from Bagirmi\" by Dixon Denham, 1823."},{"name":"bagirmi_Doudmourrah.jpg","desc":"The Mbang Abd ar Rahman Gwaranga (Left), c. 1918."}],"vid":[],"url":[{"id":1,"url":"","title":"","desc":""}],"refs":[{"id":1,"ref":"Wikipedia contributors.
