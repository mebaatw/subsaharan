Permanent villages have been found in Nubia which date from 6000 BC. These villages were roughly contemporary with the walled town of Jericho in Palestine.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3> Early Period</h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>Early Nubian architecture was found in the A-Group culture(c. 3800 BC to c. 3100 BC.) which flourished in lower Nubia, Sudan. Most archeological finds from the A-Group culture come from cemeteries located a few miles away from the Nile.[2] </p>\n<p>Excavations at an A-Group cemetery in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qustul\">Qustul</a> yielded an old incense burner, which was adorned with Ancient Egyptian royal iconography:</p>\n<p><i>\"This incense burner is distinctively Nubian in form. Carved in the technique of Nubian rock art, it is decorated on the rim with typical Nubian designs. It was found in the tomb of a Nubian ruler at Qustul and incorporates images associated with Egyptian pharaohs: a procession of sacred boats, the White Crown of Upper Egypt, a falcon deity, and the palace facade called a serekh. It appears to represent a ritual that involved a royal procession by boat to a palace.</p>\n<p>The scenes depicted on the Qustul Incense Burner have excited considerable interest and discussion - why would seemingly Egyptian symbols have been used in Nubia?</p>\n<p>One interpretation is that Nubian A-Group rulers and early Egyptian pharaohs used related royal symbols. Similarities in rock art of A-Group Nubia and Upper Egypt support this position.</p>\n<p>Another view suggests that the decoration was carved by Nubians in imitation of Egyptian art and rituals. In this perspective, A-Group Nubian rulers would have emulated the symbols of Egyptian pharaohs, whose prestige and power were evident.\"[20]</i></p>\n<p>The A-Group culture came to an end around 3100 BC, when it was destroyed by the First Dynasty rulers of Egypt.</p>\n<p>The A-Group culture was followed later by the C-Group culture (2200-1500 BCE). Settlements consisted of round structures with stone floors. The C-Group culture had roots in sub-saharan African culture: </p>\n<p><i>\"Small circular houses with stone foundations, handmade ceramics with elaborate incised decoration, and graves covered with circular stone mounds are features that C-Group shared with earlier Nubian A-Group and Pre-Kerma cultures. But the importance of cattle in the C-Group, shown in its burial stelae, pottery, figurines, and rock drawings, also links it firmly to the African cattle cultures that began in the Neolithic and then spread across sub-Saharan Africa.\"[21]</i></p>\n<p>The C-Group culture also had deep ties with Egypt:</p>\n<p><i>\"C-Group cemeteries are found as far north as Hierakonpolis in southern Egypt, and Egyptians traveled and traded in Nubia. Many Nubians were soldiers in Egyptian armies. Nubian troops featured prominently in warfare during Egypt’s First Intermediate Period (about 2100 BC), a time of civil unrest. Egyptian traders and returning Nubian soldiers brought Egyptian goods including amulets, pots, and valuable gold and silver necklaces to Nubia. Though first ruled by Egypt and then by Kerma, C-Group culture retained its own distinctive customs for centuries. Later, C-Group traditions became less visible in archaeological remains as Nubians adopted Egyptian styles during the Egyptian New Kingdom occupation of Nubia (1550–1069 BC).\"[21]</i></p>\n<p>The C-Group culture was related to the Kerma Culture. Archeologists uncovered several ancient constructions dating back to the pre-Kerma period (4th millennium BC- 2600 BC).[3]</p>\n<p>\"<i> The planning of the major Pre-Kerma settlement, in the locality of the Eastern Kerma Cemetery, reveals an urban architectural system, where monumental buildings, rectangular storage houses, cattle pens, palisades, and storehouses were uncovered. Exceptionally large huts, with one reaching 7 meters in diameter, found there have been interpreted by some as residence of wealthy individuals.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a large number of buildings were found within the expanded town of Kerma... Several buildings have been identified as royal residences; usually consisting of interconnected rooms and courtyard enclosures.</p>\n<p>The architectural materials, structures, and the presence of staircases in most of the palaces suggest that they were mostly built of more than one floor. The majority of them had rectangular or square plans with long corridors and narrow rectangular rooms; a hallway was usually present after passing through the main entrance.[3]\n</i>\"</p>\n<br/>\n<h3> <a href=\"/subsaharan/kerma-city\">Kerma</a> </h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>Kerma (also known as Dukki Gel) was the capital city of the Kerma culture in present-day Sudan. Kerma was settled around 2500 BCE. </p>\n<p>It was a walled city containing a religious building, large circular dwelling, a palace, and well laid out roads. </p>\n<p><i>\"Kerma has been excavated by a Swiss team for more than 30 years. The team has discovered the remains of temples, cemeteries and a city wall with bastions. Their discoveries reveal that the city was a center for trade with gold, ivory and cattle among other commodities being traded by Kerma's inhabitants. The exact amount of territory that Kerma controlled is uncertain, but it appears to have encompassed part of what is now Sudan and southern Egypt.\"</i>[6]</p>\n<p>Bronze forges were excavated by Bonnet’s Swiss team in the Kerma main city. <i>“It is within the walls of the religious center that a bronze workshop was built. The workshop consisted of multiple forges and the artisans’ techniques appear to have been quite elaborate. There is no comparable discovery in Egypt or in Sudan to help us interpret these remains\"[9]</i></p>\n<p>Kerma was built around a large adobe temple known as the  Deffufa, a mud brick temple where ceremonies were performed on top.[4] </p>\n<p>The deffufa is a unique structure in Nubian Architecture. Three known deffufas exist: the <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Western_Deffufa\">Western Deffufa</a> at Kerma,  <a href=\"http://www.traveladventures.org/continents/africa/kerma-deffufas04.html\">Eastern Deffufa</a>, and a third, little-known deffufa. </p>\n<p><i>\"The Western Deffufa forms an imposing sight in the vicinity of the small Sudanese town of Kareema. Like the other Deffufas, it was built of thick mud-brick walls to provide cooler temperature in the hot climate. The structure is comprised of three stories and stretches over an area of 15,070 sq feet and is about 18 m. tall. The Deffufa is farther surrounded by a boundary wall.</p>\n<p>Inside the Deffufa were columned chambers connected by a complex network of passageways. The walls were lavishly decorated with faience tiles and inlays and gold leaf. Magnificent paintings showing exotic scenes of the wild-life from the sub-Sahara served as visual luxury in Kerma's arid environment. A staircase seems to have lead to a shrine on the roof of the building. Evidence of a limestone altar, built for animal sacrifice, was also found. The repeated works of construction and development efforts indicate the centrality of the monument in the town of Kerma; most likely the town's principal temple.\"[7]</i></p>\n<p>The Eastern Deffufa lies 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) east of the Western Deffufa. The Eastern Deffufa is shorter than the Western Deffufa, just two stories high. It is considered a funerary chapel, being surrounded by 30,000 tumuli or graves. It has two columned halls. The walls are decorated with portraiture of animal in color schemes of red, blue, yellow, and black and stone laid floors. Exterior walls were layered with stone.[7] </p>\n<p>The third deffufa is of similar structure as the Eastern Deffufa.</p>\n<p>Kerma contains a cemetery with over 30,000 graves. The cemetery shows a general pattern of larger graves ringed by smaller ones, suggesting social stratification.</p>\n<p><i>\"The people of Kerma people buried their dead in niche cut pits. A tumulus or a mound superstructure of sand and gravel, sometimes reaching 90 meters in diameter, was built over the graves of royal persons. The size of the mound indicated the social rank of the deceased person when alive. The larger the tumulus, the higher in rank the owner was; and the smaller it is, the lower in status.</p>\n<p>A distinctive element of the Kerma culture was the unique bed burial tradition. The distinctive design and manufacture of the Kerma bed didn't change over time; it represents the traditional Sudanese bed today and is called Angaraib. The deceased was placed on top of the bed. The bed was then placed in the middle of the tomb chamber. On some cases, mummification was conducted on deceased kings and royal persons. The body was usually laid in a contracted body position with the head towards the east.</p>\n<p>Flag staffs and square shaped steles were uncovered near tumuli structures and were probably related to the building structures.\"[8]</i></p>\n<p>Kerma's artefacts are characterized by extensive amounts of blue <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums-static/digitalegypt/nubia/faience.html\">faience</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mrs-online-proceedings-library-archive/article/replication-of-glazed-quartzite-from-kerma-capital-of-ancient-kush-sudan/A2EA043AF2A07D2BD7571DFCE592836C\">glazed quartzite</a>[5]  which are distinct in details and technique from those in Egypt.</p>\n<div style=\"overflow: auto; white-space: nowrap;display: inline-block;\">\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-UI5j5MK0RA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen>\n    </iframe>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/njCa1rdjw6I\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<h3><a href=\"/subsaharan/kush_kngdm\">Kush</a> and <a href=\"/subsaharan/napata-nubia\">Napata</a></h3>\n<hr/>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0FHlxMh3hw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0PgIPQ5_FI\nhttp://isaw.nyu.edu/exhibitions/nubia/highlights.html\nBetween 1500-1085 BCE, Egyptian conquest and domination of Nubia was achieved. This conquest brought about the Napatan Phase of Nubian history.\n<p>Napata was founded by Egyptian pharaoh<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose_III\">Thutmose III</a> in the 15th century BC after his conquest of Nubia. The nearby Jebel Barkal was taken to mark the southern border of the New Kingdom of Egypt.</p>\n<p>In 1075 BCE fragmentation of power in Egypt allowed the Nubians to regain autonomy. They founded the Kingdom of Kush, which was centered at Napata, and eventually conquered Egypt in 750 BC. They constitute the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt\">Twenty-fifth Dynasty</a> in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho#Aegyptiaca\">Manetho’s Aegyptiaca</a>. The Twenty-fifth Dynasty ruled for a little more than one hundred years.</p>\n<p>The reunited Egyptian empire under the 25th dynasty was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom and ushered in a renaissance. </p>\n<p><i>\"...the 25th Dynasty \"Negro\" kings are now recognized as having sponsored an important renaissance of Egyptian art and culture; they developed an almost scholarly interest in ancient Egyptian traditions and language and have been called \"the first Egyptologists.\" The empire over which they presided was greater in extent than any ever achieved in antiquity along the Nile Valley. Their kings were said never to have condemned prisoners to death; they forgave their enemies and allowed them to retain their offices; they also actually gave public credit for achievement in their inscriptions to individuals other than themselves. Such characteristics among other ancient monarchs of Egypt or the Near East are unheard of, and we can only assume these were native Nubian qualities.\"[10]</i></p>\n<p>The Nubian Pharaohs, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taharqa\">Taharqa</a>, built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile Valley, including at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebel_Barkal\">Jebel Barkal</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Egypt\">Memphis</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnak\">Karnak</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawa_(Sudan)\">Kawa</a>,  and elsewhere.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/subsaharan/jebel-barkal\">Jebel Barkal</a> was of much spiritual significance to Nubian pharaohs. They held pharaonic coronation and consulted its oracle. It was thought to be the dwelling place of the deity Amun at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Amun,_Jebel_Barkal\"> Temple of Amun</a> (B500). </p>\n<p>The Temple of Amun was originally built during the Egyptian New Kingdom but greatly enhanced by the Nubian King <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piye\">Piye</a>:</p>\n<p><i>\"Piye was certainly remembered not as a conquering overlord, but as a just and great ancestor: He was later deified, with examples such as “Piankhi-yerike-qa” – “Begotten of the deified Piankhi” (Macadam, 1949, p.73). Posterity remembered him well as a holy king who\nruled by the will of Amun. He commenced extensive building work at the temple of Amun at Gebel Barkal, and Grimal (1995, p.340) theorizes that to the Kushites, “The Gebel Barkal\ntemple was therefore a replica of the temple of Amun in Karnak” and notes how each king after Piye enlarged upon it, in much the same way had been done at Karnak. Perhaps his work  there was a deliberate attempt to start this trend, or was simply an expression of the power and resources that had been given to him by his god. Piye’s stele is certainly not an isolated example of Amun “fundamentalism”, but is a part of a wider context in which Piye can be seen to be attempting to recreate a time of prosperity and devotion to the god that he worshipped. Myśliwiec (2000, p.84) notes “the perfection with which stress is apportioned\nand appropriate proportions are maintained with regard to its political and religious aspects”, in a “carefully thought-out and didactic manner”. This should demonstrate to us how the stele was a carefully planned way to present Piye in the way that he wanted to be remembered –\nnot as a master political lord, but primarily as a worshipper of Amun.\" [14]</i></p>\n<p> Other temples include <a href=\"https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-wall-reliefs-on-the-osirian-temple-of-taharqa-in-the-karnak-temple-113673461.html\">Temple of Taharqa</a> (B200); Taharqa's other temples:<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Mut,_Jebel_Barkal\">Temples for Mut</a>, <a href=\"http://www.jebelbarkal.org/frames/B200300.pdf\">Hathor</a>, and Bes (B300);  B501 (outer court), B502 (hypostyle hall), B700 (temple), B800sub (temple of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alara_of_Nubia\">Alara of Nubia</a>), B1200 (palace).

They are smaller but greater in number than the pyramids of Egypt. </p>\n<p>The general construction of Nubian pyramids consisted of steep walls, a chapel facing East, stairway facing East, and a chamber access via the stairway.[12][13]</p>\n<p> Nubian pyramids were constructed on three major sites: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El-Kurru\">El-Kurru</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuri\">Nuri</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mero%C3%AB\">Meroë</a>. </p>\n<br/>\n<h3> <a href=\"https://www.ancient.eu/Meroe/\">Meroë</a></h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>Meroë (c. 785 BC – c. AD 350) was the capital of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kush\">Kingdom of Kush</a>.</p>\n<p>Meroë is considered to be the largest archaeological site in the world. It contains more Nubian Pyramids than any other site.</p>\n<p>The culture shows a mixture of indigenous and Egyptian influences:</p>\n<p><i>\"Meroitic culture shows much Egyptian influence, always mixed with local ideas. Many temples housed cults to Egyptian gods like Amun (called Amani) and Isis, but indigenous deities received royal patronage as well. A very prominent Nubian god was the lion-deity Apedemak, a god of war whose popularity increased substantially in this period. Local gods were often associated with Egyptian ones: in Lower Nubia, Mandulis, for example, was considered to be Horus's son. </p>\n<p>Hybridity is also visible in the arts and in royal ideology. For example, kings of Meroe were represented in monumental images on temples in Egyptian fashion but with local elements, such as garments, crowns, and weapons.\"[15]</i></p>\n<p>The ancient Nubians established a system of geometry including early versions of sun clocks. Many are located at the sites of Meroë.The ancient Nubians used a trigonometric methodology similar to the Egyptians.[17]</p>\n<p><i>\"Mapping of standing stones and megalithic structures at Nabta in the Nubian Desert, 500 miles south of Cairo, suggests that the Neolithic nomads who once inhabited the area were not only monitoring the heavens, but recording what they saw in monumental form. According to an article in Nature by J. McKim Malville of the University of Colorado, Fred Wendorf of Southern Methodist University, and others, the megaliths were placed in deposits that probably accumulated between 7,000 and 6,700 years ago in a playa inundated by summer rains.</p>\n<p>Alignments of standing stones and megalithic structures (oval clusters of recumbent stones) extend for up to a mile, marking north and east as well as 24 to 28 and 126 degrees east of north, directions whose meanings are still being worked out. A ten-foot circle composed primarily of stone slabs has four \"windows\" marked by pairs of standing stones; the four are arranged in two pairs, one forming a north-south line of sight and the other a line stretching from 62 to 298 degrees east of north. The latter coincides approximately with the summer solstice sunrise 6,000 years ago, which would have fallen about 63 degrees east of north.</p>\n<p>Malville and Wendorf speculate that the megaliths, \"partly submerged in the rising waters of the summer monsoon,\" may have marked the onset of the rainy season and created \"a symbolic geometry that integrated death, water, and the sun.\" They also suggest that the migration of these nomads north as the summer rains dried up about 4,800 years ago may have stimulated the development of complex cultures and degrees of social status in predynastic Upper Egypt. Within a few hundred years, the pharaoh Djoser built the first pyramid, the step monument at Saqqara.\" [16]</i></p>\n<br/>\n<h3>Christian Nubia</h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>The Christianization of Nubia began in the 6th century AD. Its most representative architecture are churches. </p>\n<p>Construction of the churches varried depending on climate of and region:</p>\n<p><i>\"Cut stone, generally quarried from nearby temples, was the preferred material for the earliest Nubian churches. Roughly dressed native stone, laid in heavy mortar, was also employed. There was some use of mud brick in the smaller churches from the beginning, and in later centuries it became the almost universal building material. Only in the extreme north and the extreme south of Nubia - both areas subject to occasional rainfall - was there some continued use of stone in later times. Red (fired) brick was rarely used except for repairs and secondary construction. Only one church in Lower Nubia, at Faras West, was built primarily of red brick. On the other hand, several churches in Upper Nubia, at Sai, Old Dongola (Church of the Columns), Gandesi, and El Usheir, appear to have been built of red brick.</p>\n<p>Many if not all of the earliest churches had flat, timbered roofs which were supported on monolithic columns. However, suitable timber soon became scarce, and in later centuries all Nubian churches had vaulted brick roofs, often with a central dome or cupola. Because of the peculiar unwieldiness of the Nubian vault, this method of construction necessitated in every case the replacement of stone columns by stout masonry piers. The last church in Lower Nubia to be built with columns and (presumably) a flat roof was the South Kom Church at Faras, dedicated in 930 AD...</p>\n<p>The external plan of the Nubian church is almost invariably a simple rectangle, having its long axis east-west...</p>\n<p>Both the overall size of the church building and the proportion of length of width diminished continually during the Christian period. The earliest churches were consistently large, long and narrow. The Basilica at Kasr Ibrim, built probably in the 6th or 7th Century, is the largest known church in Nubia, measuring 3 X 19m. The length width ratio in the early churches averaged 1.67 to 1, and sometimes reached 2 to 1. At the end of the Christian period the dimensions of most churches were under 10m., and the plan was virtually square. The total area covered by the building diminished by 90%, from an average 350sqm. to 35sqm.\n...\nThe first Nubian churches, whose plan included a narthex, were entered from the west, either by a single door in the center of the west wall or by doors at the extreme western ends of the side (north and south) walls, or both. However, the narthex went out of fashion almost at once, and the mode of entry was altered accordingly. Almost all Nubian churches from the 7th Century onward were entered by doors in the north and the south walls located slightly to the west of the center of the building...\n\" [18]</i></p>\n<p>Church painting with biblical themes were extensive but few survived. The best surviving church painting were on the Rivergate Church of Faras and the Church of Ab El Qadir.</p>\n<p>One prominent feature of Nubian churches are vaults (dome) made out of mud-bricks. The mud-brick structure was revived by Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy after rediscovering the technique in the Nubian village of Abu al-Riche . The technology is advocated by environmentalist as environmentally friendly and sustainable, since it makes use of pure earth without the need of timber.[19]</p>\n<p>One of the key advantages of the Nubian vault is that it can be built without any support or shuttering. The earth bricks are laid leaning at a slight slope against the gable walls in a length-wise vault, as in this photo of a building from the ruins of Ayn Asil in Egypt. The same principle can be used to build domes, as in the example below from Cameroon.</p>\n<p>These environmentally sound, comfortable, and aesthetic buildings require neither imported sheet metal for the roofing, nor expensive and increasingly rare timber beams.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3>Islamic Nubia</h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>The conversion to Islam was a slow, gradual process, with almost 600 years of resistance. Most of the architecture of the period are mosques built of mud-bricks. One of the first attempt at conquest was by Egyptian-Nubian, Ibn Abi Sarh. Ibn Abi Sarh was a Muslim leader who tried to conquer all Nubia in the 8th century AD. It was almost a complete failure. An agreement called the Baqt, shaped Egyptian-Nubian relations for six centuries, and permitted the construction of a mosque in the Nubian capital of Dongola for Muslim travelers. By the middle of the 14th century, Nubia had been converted to Islam. The royal Church of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throne_Hall_of_Dongola\">Dongola</a> was converted into a mosque. Numerous other churches were converted to mosque.[22]</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"4adaa99a-3786-5ec3-a535-458a2e88bee4","frontmatter":{"country":"Mauritania","title":"Dhar Tichitt","date":"4000 BP"},"fields":{"slug":"dhar-tichitt"},"excerpt":"Dhar Tichitt is a Neolithic archaeological site located in the southwestern region of the Sahara Desert, in Mauritania.

The earliest examples of Sudano-Sahelian style probably come from Jenné-Jeno around 250 BC, where the first evidence of permanent mudbrick architecture in the region is found.[1]</p>\n<br/>\n<h3>Difference between Savannah and Sahelian styles</h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>The earthen architecture in the Sahel zone region is noticeably different from the building style in the neighboring savannah. The \"old Sudanese\" cultivators of the savannah built their compounds out of several cone-roofed houses. This was primarily an urban building style, associated with centres of trade and wealth, characterised by cubic buildings with terraced roofs comprise the typical style.</p>\n<p>They lend a characteristic appearance to the close-built villages and cities. Large buildings such as mosques, representative residential and youth houses stand out in the distance. They are landmarks in a flat landscape that point to a complex society of farmers, craftsmen and merchants with a religious and political upper class.</p>\n<p>With the expansion of Sahelian kingdoms south to the rural areas in the savannas (inhabited by culturally or ethnically similar groups to those in the Sahel), the Sudano-Sahelian style was reserved for mosques, palaces, the houses of nobility or townsfolk (as is evident in the Gur-Voltaic style), whereas among commonfolk, there was a mix between either typically distinct Sudano-Sahelian styles for wealthier families, and older African roundhut styles for rural villages and family compounds.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3>Substyles</h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>The Sudano-Sahelian architectural style itself can be broken down into four smaller sub-styles that are typical of different ethnic groups in the region. The examples used here illustrate the construction of mosques as well as palaces, as the architectural style is concentrated around inland Muslim populations.</p>\n<p>As with the people, many of these styles cross-pollinate and produce buildings with shared features. Any one of these styles is not exclusive to one particular modern countries borders, but are linked to the ethnicity of its builders or surrounding populations. For example, a Malian migrant community in traditionally Gur area may build in the style characteristic of their ancestral homeland, while neighbouring Gur buildings are built in the local style. These styles include: </p>\n<h3>Malian Architecture</h3>\n<p>The architecture of Mali comprises adobe buildings such as <a href=\"/Djenne-Djenno/\">The Great Mosque of Djenne</a> or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Timbuktu\">University of Timbuktu</a>. It can be found all over the Sahel region. Malian architecture developed during the <a href=\"/ghana-empire\">Ghana Empire</a> which founded most of Mali's great cities. They then flourished in West Africa's two greatest civilisations the <a href=\"/mali_empire\">Mali Empire</a> and the <a href=\"/songhai\">Songhai Empire</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/timbuktu-city\">Timbuktu</a> has many adobe and mud brick buildings but the most famous is the University. The masajids (mosques) of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankore_Madrasah\">Sankore</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djinguereber_Mosque\">Djinguereber</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kani-Kombole\">Kani-Kombole Mosque</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidi_Yahya_Mosque\">Sidi Yahya</a> were the centres of learning in medieval <a href=\"/mali_empire\">Mali</a> and produced some of the most famous works in Africa, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbuktu_Manuscripts\">Timbuktu Manuscripts</a>.\n<br>\n<br/>    </p>\n<h3>Fortress style</h3>\n<p>Fortress style is predominantly used by the Zarma peoples of northern Nigeria and Niger, Hausa-Fulani, Tuareg and Arab mixed communities in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agadez\">Agadez</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanuri_people\">Kanuri</a> people of Lake Chad, and <a href=\"/songhai\">Songhai</a> of northeastern Mali. Military aspect to construction of high protective compound walls built around a central courtyard. Minaret is the only structure with support beams showing. Characterized by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankore_Madrasah\">Sankore Mosque</a> of Timbuktu, the tomb of Askia in <a href=\"/gao_empire\">Gao</a> Mali, and the Agadez mosque of northern Niger.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3> Hausa Architecture </h3>\n<p>Hausa architecture (known as Tubali in the Hausa language) is a distinct sub-style among the various Sudano-Sahelian architectural styles predominant in North and Northwestern Nigeria, Niger, Eastern Burkina Faso, Northern Benin, and found throughout the Sahel-geographic band stretching from Senegal and Mauritania in the West to Sudan in the east.</p>\n<p>Hausa buildings are characterized by the use of dry mud bricks in cubic structures, multi-storied buildings for the social elite, the use of parapets related to their military/fortress building past, and traditional white stucco and plaster for house fronts. At times the facades may be decorated with various abstract relief designs, sometimes painted in vivid colours to convey information about the occupant.</p>\n<p>Examples include the architecture of the <a href=\"https://www.akdn.org/architecture/project/yaama-mosque\">Yamma Mosque</a> and old town of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinder\">Zinder</a>, The Hausa quarter of Agadez Niger, the Gidan Rumfa of <a href=\"/kano-state\">Kano</a>, and various Hausa districts across West Africa.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3> Volta basin</h3>\n<p>Volta basin of the Gur and Manden groups of Burkina Faso, northern Ghana and northern Cote d'Ivoire. The most conservative of the three styles. A single courtyard, characterized by high white and black painted walls, inward curved turrets supporting an exterior wall, and a larger turret nearer the center. Characterized by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larabanga\">Larabanga</a> mosque of Ghana and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobo-Dioulasso\">Bobo-Dioulasso</a> Grand Mosque.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3>Sudano-Sahelian Styles by Region</h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>At <a href=\"/koumbi-saleh\">Kumbi Saleh</a>, locals lived in dome-shaped dwellings in the king's section of the city, surrounded by a great enclosure. Traders lived in stone houses in a section which possessed 12 beautiful mosques (as described by al-Bakri), one of which was for Friday prayer.[16] The king is said to have owned several mansions, one of which was sixty-six feet long and forty-two feet wide, contained seven rooms, was two stories high, and had a staircase, with paintings on the walls and chambers filled with sculpture.</p>\n<p>Sahelian architecture initially grew from the two cities of Djenné and Timbuktu. The Sankore Mosque, constructed from mud on timber, was similar in style to the Great Mosque of Djenné.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/ashanti\">Ashanti</a> architecture from Ghana is perhaps best known from the reconstruction at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumasi\">Kumasi</a>. Its key features are courtyard-based buildings, and walls with striking reliefs in brightly painted mud plaster. An example of a shrine can be seen at Bawjiase in Ghana. Four rectangular rooms, constructed from wattle and daub, lie around a courtyard. Animal designs mark the walls, and palm leaves cut to a tiered shape provide the roof.</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"a4d3f772-2718-5e51-8362-d3270fb0a782","frontmatter":{"country":"Mali","title":"Djenné-Djenno","date":""},"fields":{"slug":"Djenne-Djenno"},"excerpt":"Djenné-Djenno (also Jenne-Jeno) is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the Niger River Valley in the country of Mali.

This archaeological site is believed to have been involved in long distance trade and possibly the domestication of African rice. The site is known to have been occupied from 250 B.C. to 900 A.D. The city is believed to have been abandoned and moved where the current city is located due to the spread of Islam and the building of the Great Mosque of Djenné. </p>\n<p>This first occupation of the site (which lasted from 250 B.C. to A.D. 50) is known as Phase I and is some of the earliest evidence for iron production in sub-Saharan Africa. Geomorphological data show that the region consisted mostly of swampland at that time. Groups only began permanently occupying the area after a dry episode in which annual flooding receded and decreased the size of the swamps. Faunal remains at the site from this occupation have included catfish and Nile perch but mostly cow, leading to the assumption that this first phase might be associated with hunter-gatherer or pastoral modes of subsistence. During this period there is no evidence for rice production, however it is believed that these people might have been rice producers, even though no definitive evidence has been discovered yet.</p>\n<p>Phase II is defined by a larger population and definitive evidence for the mass production of rice. The borders of the site expanded during this period (possibly covering 100,000 square meters or more), as well as the presence of permanent mud brick architecture. </p>\n<p>Phase III dates from about A.D. 300 to A.D. 900 and is believed to have an even higher population based on crowded cemeteries. The site also has evidence for a more intensive occupation through deep house deposits, possibly from multiple generations.</p>\n<p>Djenné-Djenno is famous for its terracotta figurines which depict humans and animals including snakes and horses. Throughout the site's occupations, pottery fragments are abundant. Some of the more interesting clay artifacts begin in Phase II with terra-cotta statuettes and representations of humans and animals on pottery. These statuettes are important to the understanding of Phase II because along with this art, the first evidence for large-scale rice cultivation and population rise. All of these attributes are commonly associated with complex, state-level societies. It is believed that these artifacts posed ritual function as opposed to a domestic function. Some of these clay figurines are similar to those made by modern Fulani pastoralists for children.</p>\n<p>Evidence for domestic cow, sheep and goat cultivation is present at the site. </p>\n<p>The land surrounding Djenné-Djenno lent itself to such high-yielding crops due to its mixture of highland and floodplain soils at different elevations that allowed floodwater farming of rice. Moreover, the Djenné-Djenno site lies in close proximity to dune landscape, which allows for necessary recreation needed for keeping cattle in floodplain environments. Overall, the diversified sources of food provided food security that allowed for permanent settlement in a region of volatile climate. It is believed that this food production, especially that of African rice, was one of the main contributors to population rise in the city of Djenné-Djenno and was widely exported to nearby centers (including Timbuktu).</p>\n<p>It is suspected that Djenné-Djenno grew to such a vast size as a result of regional and local trade. Archaeological evidence supports that Djenné-Djenno was part of a pre-Arab trans-Saharan trade network. Glass beads found at the site have been dated to as early as the third century BC and appear to originate from Asia to the Mediterranean Near East. Copper ornaments have also been found in early Phase II deposits, which shows these trade networks date to earlier than previously thought. These discoveries lend support to the existence of sporadic contacts between West and North Africa throughout the first millennium AD.</p>\n<p>Since there is no evidence for a fourth phase, it is expected that towards the end of Phase III the city experienced a slow decline in population and eventually a total abandonment. However, very little is known about why this decline happened, and more research is needed.</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"0664a23e-75fb-5d72-827a-55a438912949","frontmatter":{"country":"Eritrea","title":"Matara","date":""},"fields":{"slug":"matara_city"},"excerpt":"Matara (Metera) is an archaeological site in Eritrea.

Makuria was one of the few states in the world to repulse Muslim conquests led by the Rashidun Caliphate when they defeated an Arab army at the First Battle of Dongola in 642. The Arabs had taken Egypt in 641, and the jihad soon turned south. Makuria repeated the feat in 652 at the Second Battle of Dongola. Arab writers noted the Makurians' skill as archers in both battles. One of the few major defeats suffered by an Arab army in the first century of Islamic expansion, it led to an unprecedented agreement: the bakt. This treaty guaranteed peaceful relations between the two sides. The Nubians agreed to give Arab traders more privileges of trade in addition to a share in their slave trading, while the Egyptians may have been obliged to send manufactured goods south.</p>\n<p>Makuria expanded by annexing its northern neighbor Nobatia, a process which would have occurred at some point after the Sasanian conquest of Egypt, but was completed until the reign of King Merkurios. It also maintained close dynastic ties with the kingdom of Alodia to the south. The period from the 9th to 11th century saw the peak of Makuria's cultural development: new monumental buildings were erected, arts like wall paintings and finely crafted and decorated pottery flourished and Nubian grew to become the prevalent written language.</p>\n<p>One of the most important discoveries of the rushed work prior to the flooding of Lower Nubia was the Cathedral of Faras. This large building had been completely filled with sand preserving a series of magnificent paintings. Similar, but less well preserved, paintings have been found at several other sites in Makuria, including palaces and private homes, giving an overall impression of Makurian art. The style and content was heavily influenced by Byzantine art, and also showed influence from Egyptian Coptic art and from Palestine. Mainly religious in nature, it depicts many of the standard Christian scenes. Also illustrated are a number of Makurian kings and bishops, with noticeably darker skin than the Biblical figures.</p>\n<p>Women enjoyed a high social standing. The matrilineal succession gave the queen mother and the sister of the current king as forthcoming queen mother great political relevance. Women had access to education and there is evidence that, like in Byzantine Egypt, female scribes existed. Private land tenure was open to both men and women, meaning that both could own, buy and sell land. Transfers of land from mother to daughter were common. </p>\n<p>The main economic activity in Makuria was agriculture, with farmers growing several crops a year of barley, millet, and dates. One important technological advance was the saqiya, an oxen-powered water wheel, that was introduced in the Roman period and helped increase yields and population density. Settlement patterns indicate that land was divided into individual plots rather than as in a manorial system. The peasants lived in small villages composed of clustered houses of sun-dried brick.</p>\n<p>Important industries included the production of pottery, based at Faras, and weaving based at Dongola. Smaller local industries include leatherworking, metalworking, and the widespread production of baskets, mats, and sandals from palm fibre. Also important was the gold mined in the Red Sea Hills to the east of Makuria. Cattle was of great economic importance. </p>\n<p>Increased aggression from Egypt, internal discord, bedouin incursions and possibly the plague and the shift of trade routes led to the state's decline in the 13th and 14th century. Due to a civil war in 1365, the kingdom was reduced to a rump state that lost much of its southern territories, including Dongola. It had disappeared by the 1560s, when the Ottoman occupied Lower Nubia. Nubia was subsequently Islamized, while the Nubians living upstream of Al Dabbah and in Kordofan were also Arabized.</p>\n<p>Read more:\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makuria\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makuria</a></p>"}},{"node":{"id":"aa62c08d-f6ce-531c-a3be-457f6caaa262","frontmatter":{"country":"Tanzania","title":"Kilwa Kisiwani","date":"700 CE. - 1400 CE"},"fields":{"slug":"kilwa-kswni"},"excerpt":"Kilwa Kisiwani is an archaeological city-state located on an Indian Ocean island off the southern coast of present-day Tanzania in eastern Africa.

Scattered pieces of the structure remain in Edo, with the vast majority of them being used by the locals for building purposes. What remains of the wall itself continues to be torn down for real estate developments.[2] Fred Pearce wrote in New Scientist:</p>\n<p>They extend for some 16,000 km in all, in a mosaic of more than 500 interconnected settlement boundaries. They cover 2,510 sq. miles (6,500 square kilometres) and were all dug by the Edo people. In all, they are four times longer than the Great Wall of China, and consumed a hundred times more material than the Great Pyramid of Cheops. They took an estimated 150 million hours of digging to construct, and are perhaps the largest single archaeological phenomenon on the planet.[3]</p>\n<p>Ethnomathematician Ron Eglash has discussed the planned layout of the city using fractals as the basis, not only in the city itself and the villages but even in the rooms of houses. He commented that \"When Europeans first came to Africa, they considered the architecture very disorganised and thus primitive. It never occurred to them that the Africans might have been using a form of mathematics that they hadn’t even discovered yet.\"[4]</p>\n<p>The city was destroyed by British soldiers in 1897. </p>"}},{"node":{"id":"18972033-bc47-5b0f-ba6f-a0913ec6d3bc","frontmatter":{"country":"Zimbabwe","title":"Kingdom of Zimbabwe","date":"1220–1450"},"fields":{"slug":"zimbabwe-kngdm"},"excerpt":" The Kingdom of Zimbabwe (c. 1220–1450) was a medieval BakaLanga kingdom located in modern-day Zimbabwe.

The early art-historical and archaeological records reinforce these strong affiliations with Ife culture. Owo was able to maintain virtual independence from the neighboring kingdom of Benin, but was on occasion required to give tribute. The transmission of courtly culture flowed in both directions between the Benin and the Owo kingdoms. The skill of Owo's ivory carvers was also appreciated at the court of Benin. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Benin's rulers increasingly utilized insignia made from ivory, and imported Owo's art objects and recruited its artisans for their own royal workshops. There were other notable artworks that can be evidently supported.</p>\n<p>Owo came under British rule in 1893. After Nigeria declared independence in 1960, it was part of the Western Region until 1967 when it became part of the Western State. Owo and its indigenes played significant roles in the politics of the first Republic in Nigeria. In 1976, it became part of the newly created Ondo State.</p>\n<p>Owo has the largest palace (Aghofen) in Africa which was declared a national monument by the federal government. The Olowo Palace had as many as 100 courtyards (Ugha). Each courtyard had a specific function and was dedicated to a particular deity. The largest, said to have been twice the size of an American football field, was used for public assemblies and festivals. Some courtyards were paved with quartz pebbles or broken pottery. Pillars supporting the veranda roofs were carved with statues of the king mounted on a horse or shown with his senior wife. The present Olowo is Oba Folagbade Olateru Olagbegi III.</p>\n<p>The present-day city is an agricultural center involved in the growing and trade of yams, cassava, maize, okra, peppers, cocoa, and cotton. There are, however, other meaningful commercial activities in the town, including but not limited to: timber and sawmilling, Soya bean processing plants and blockmaking industries. The town is dotted with branches of some of the foremost banks like, First Bank Plc, Wema Bank Plc, Skye Bank Plc, Enterprise Bank Ltd. (formerly Omega Bank Plc), etc. The city is now witnessing a dramatic change due to expansion of its road network, particularly dualization of the main road beginning from Emure junction up to Iyere exit.

They planted crops such as sorghum and millet and the state depended heavily on subsistence farming. Livestock was also another important agricultural branch. They kept animals such as sheep, goats, cattle and chickens; those with many livestock were considered rich and were accorded very high economic status within the society. Trade was another important economic activity and the Rozvi practiced both internal and external trade. From foreign traders they obtained imported goods such as guns, salt, beads and sea shells; in return they bartered ivory, copper and gold. Mining was another major branch and was done by males.
