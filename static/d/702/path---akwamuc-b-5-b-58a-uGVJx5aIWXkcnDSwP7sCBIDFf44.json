{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Akwamu (also called Akuambo) was a state set up by Akan people (in present-day Ghana) that flourished in the 17th and 18th centuries. The name was also applied to its people. Originally emigrating from Bono state, the Akan founders settled in Twifo-Heman. The Akwamu led an expansionist empire in the 17th and 18th centuries. At the peak of their empire, the Akan created an influential culture that has contributed to at least three countries in West Africa.</p>\n<p>Akwamus are the Abrade (Aduana) Clan of Akan tribe. According to the oral traditions, they originated from ancient Ghana. They migrated from the north, they went through Egypt and settled in Nubia (Sudan). Around 500 AD (5th century), due to the pressure exerted on Nubia by Axumite kingdom of Ethiopia, Nubia was shattered, and they moved to the west and established small trading kingdoms which later grew and became wealthy and powerful state. By 750 AD, the kingdom had become the ancient Ghana Empire. The Empire lasted from 750 AD to 1200 AD and collapsed as a result of the introduction of Islam in the Western Sudan, and the zeal of the Muslims to impose their religion, their ancestors left for Kong (i.e. present day Ivory Coast). From Kong they moved to Wam. From Wam they moved to Bono Manso, then to Dormaa (these are both on present day Brong-Ahafo region). The movement from Kong was necessitated by the desire of the people to find suitable Savannah conditions since they were not used to Forest life. Around the 14th century, they moved from Dormaa south and went eastwards to Twifo-Hemang, North West Cape Coast. The move was commercially motivated and settled at the Twifo-Heman forest in the later part of the 16th century. </p>\n<p>At the peak of their power, the Akwamu state encompassed much of the eastern part of the present-day Ghana. It is traditionally thought that between 1677 and 1681, the Akwamu state conquered the states of Ladoku, Agona and the fort of Whydah, as well as the Ewe people of the Ho region. The Akwamu also conquered the Ga people and occupied the old Ga Kingdom.</p>\n<p>read more: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akwamu\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akwamu</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"akwamuc"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kingdom of Akwamuc","img":[{"name":"akwamuc_State.jpg","desc":"Akwamu National State Symbol"}],"vid":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_pZInMNO1dI"}],"url":[{"id":1,"url":"","title":"","desc":""}],"refs":[{"id":1,"ref":"Wikipedia contributors.
