{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The A-Group culture was an ancient civilization that flourished between the First and Second Cataracts of the Nile in Nubia. It lasted from c. 3800 BC to c. 3100 BC.</p>\n<p>The A-Group makers maintained commercial ties with the Ancient Egyptians. They traded commodities like incense, ebony and ivory, which were gathered from the southern riverine area. They also bartered carnelian from the Western Desert as well as gold mined from the Eastern Desert in exchange for Egyptian products, olive oil and other items from the Mediterranean basin.</p>\n<p>The A-Group makers left behind a number of cemeteries, with each necropolis containing around fifty graves. Most of what is known about this culture has been gleaned from these tombs, over 3,000 of which have been excavated. The burials are of two kinds: a more common oval pit, and a similar pit featuring a lateral funerary niche. Skeletons found within these graves were observed to be physically akin to their peers in Upper Egypt. The specimens typically had straight hair of a black or dark brown hue. On average, the men were 169.9 cm in height and the women stood around 155.5 cm. Some individuals were wrapped in leather and positioned on reed mats. </p>\n<p>All of the tombs contained various burial items, including personal ornaments, utensils and ceramics. Copper and gold artefacts initially appeared in graves of the Middle A Group, which are dated from ca. 3600–3300 cal BC (Killick 2014a). These are associated with Naqada pottery and other items of Egyptian provenance, suggesting that they too were imported. </p>\n<p>Dental trait analysis of A-Group fossils found that they were closely related to Afroasiatic-speaking populations inhabiting Northeast Africa and the Maghreb. </p>\n<p>Among the ancient populations, the A-Group people were nearest to the Kerma culture bearers and Kush populations in Upper Nubia, followed by the Meroitic, X-Group and Christian period inhabitants of Lower Nubia and the Kellis population in the Dakhla Oasis, as well as C-Group and Pharaonic era skeletons excavated in Lower Nubia and ancient Egyptians (Naqada,Badari, Hierakonpolis, Abydos and Kharga in Upper Egypt; Hawara in Lower Egypt). Among the recent groups,the A-Group makers were morphologically closest to Afroasiatic-speaking populations in the Horn of Africa,followed by the Shawia and Kabyle Berber populations of Algeria as well as Bedouin groups in Morocco, Libya and Tunisia. </p>\n<p>The A-Group culture came to an end around 3100 BC, when it was destroyed, apparently by the First Dynasty rulers of Egypt.</p>","fields":{"slug":"a-groupc"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A-Group culture","img":[{"name":"a-groupc_Nubian_A_group.jpg","desc":"Vessels of the A-Group, Musée du Louvre."},{"name":"a-groupc_Incense_Burner_Qustal.jpg","desc":"A-Group incense burner found at Qustul"},{"name":"a-groupc_Bowl.jpg","desc":"Decorated bowl of the A-Group, Musée du Louvre."},{"name":"","desc":""},{"name":"","desc":""}],"vid":[],"url":[{"id":1,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qustul","title":"Qustul","desc":"Qustul is an archaeological cemetery located on the eastern bank of the Nile in Lower Nubia, just opposite of Ballana near the Sudan frontier.
