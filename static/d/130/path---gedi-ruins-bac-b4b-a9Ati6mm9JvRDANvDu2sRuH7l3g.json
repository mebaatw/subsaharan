{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The ruins of Gedi are a historical and archaeological site near the Indian Ocean coast of eastern Kenya.</p>\n<p>The site of Gedi includes a walled town and its outlying area. All of the standing buildings at Gedi, which include mosques, a palace, and numerous houses, are made from stone, are one-story, and are distributed unevenly in the town. There are also large open areas in the settlement which contained earth and thatch houses. Stone \"pillar tombs\" are a distinctive type of Swahili Coast architecture found at Gedi as well.</p>\n<p>Gedi's location along the coast and association with similar sites along the Swahili Coast made it an important trade center.</p>\n<p>The earliest evidence for occupation at Gedi is a grave marker that has been radiocarbon dated to between 1041 to 1278, placing the original settlement of the site sometime in the eleventh or early twelfth century.</p>\n<p>Although Gedi remained unknown to most of British East Africa's colonists until the 1920s, the site was known by the local Mijikenda (Bantu) peoples. Currently, the Giriama, one of the Mijikenda tribes, maintain a large community around the Gedi ruins who view the site as a sacred and spiritual place.</p>\n<p>Read more:\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruins_of_Gedi\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruins<em>of</em>Gedi</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"gedi-ruins"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ruins of Gedi","img":[{"name":"gedi-ruins_Mosque_of_Gede.jpg","desc":"Ruins of the Great Mosque at Gedi"},{"name":"gedi-ruins_slab_from_Gede.jpg","desc":"Stone slab with original Arabic inscriptions that was used to date the site"},{"name":"gedi-ruins2.jpg","desc":"PIllar tomb at Gedi"},{"name":"gedi-ruins3.jpg","desc":"The palace at Gedi"},{"name":"","desc":""}],"vid":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ksLMViys06M"}],"url":[{"id":1,"url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/kenya-has-its-own-machu-picchuthe-lost-town-of-gedi","title":"Kenya Has Its Own Machu Picchu—the Lost Town of Gedi","desc":"In the 13th century, a town in Kenya flourished with advanced city planning (including sewage and water systems) and prolific trade.
