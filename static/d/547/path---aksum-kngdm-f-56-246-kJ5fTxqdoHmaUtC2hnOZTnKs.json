{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The Kingdom of Aksum (Tigrinya: መንግስቲ ኣኽሱም also known as the Kingdom of Axum, or the Aksumite Empire) was an ancient kingdom located in what is now Tigray Region (northern Ethiopia) and Eritrea. Axumite Emperors were powerful sovereigns, styling themselves King of kings, king of Aksum, Himyar, Raydan, Saba, Salhen, Tsiyamo, Beja and of Kush. Ruled by the Aksumites, it existed from approximately 100 AD to 940 AD. The polity was centered in the city of Axum and grew from the proto-Aksumite Iron Age period around the 4th century BC to achieve prominence by the 1st century AD. Aksum became a major player on the commercial route between the Roman Empire and Ancient India. The Aksumite rulers facilitated trade by minting their own Aksumite currency, with the state establishing its hegemony over the declining Kingdom of Kush. It also regularly entered the politics of the kingdoms on the Arabian Peninsula and eventually extended its rule over the region with the conquest of the Himyarite Kingdom. The Manichaei prophet Mani (died 274 AD) regarded Axum as one of the four great powers of his time, the others being Persia, Rome, and China.</p>\n<p>The Aksumites erected a number of monumental stelae, which served a religious purpose in pre-Christian times. One of these granite columns is the largest such structure in the world, at 90 feet.</p>\n<p>Under Ezana (fl. 320–360) Aksum adopted Christianity. In the 7th century, early Muslims from Mecca sought refuge from Quraysh persecution by travelling to the kingdom, a journey known in Islamic history as the First Hijra.</p>\n<p>The kingdom's ancient capital, also called Axum, is now a town in Tigray Region (northern Ethiopia). The Kingdom used the name \"Ethiopia\" as early as the 4th century.</p>\n<p>Tradition claims Axum as the alleged resting place of the Ark of the Covenant and the purported home of the Queen of Sheba.</p>\n<p>Read more: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aksum\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom<em>of</em>Aksum</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"aksum-kngdm"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kingdom of Aksum","img":[{"name":"aksum-kngdm_Stela.jpg","desc":"The King Ezana's Stela, an Aksumite obelisk in Axum, Ethiopia"},{"name":"aksum-kngdm_Jar_Spout.jpg","desc":"An Axumite jar spout"},{"name":"aksum-kngdm_EzanaGreekTablet.jpg","desc":"The Ezana Stone records negus Ezana's conversion to Christianity and his subjugation of various neighboring peoples, including Meroë."},{"name":"aksum-kngdm_stele.jpg","desc":"Axumite Menhir in Balaw Kalaw (Metera) near Senafe"},{"name":"aksum-kngdm_I_Textile.jpg","desc":"Fresco of king Khosrau I war against Masruq Abraha in Yemen"},{"name":"aksum-kngdm_Hijra.jpg","desc":"14th century illustration showing the king of Aksum declining the request of a Meccan delegation to yield up the Muslims.
