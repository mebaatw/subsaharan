Its capital was the ancient walled city of Fumban.</p>\n<p>The Bamum kingdom was founded by emigrants related to the Tikar royal dynasty of Nsaw. The founding king (called a \"fon\" or \"mfon\") was Nchare, a conqueror reputed to have crushed some 18 rulers. King Nchare founded the capital Foumban, then called Mfomben. This first group of Tikar emigrants conquerors absorbed the language and customs of their new subjects and were from then on known as Mbum. Later, all peoples falling under their influence would take this name. It is believed that Chamba migrations from the Tikar plain in the southern part of the western Adamawa Plateau resulted in the kingdom’s foundation.</p>","fields":{"slug":"bamum_kngdm"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kingdom of Bamum","img":[{"name":"","desc":""}],"vid":[],"url":[{"id":1,"url":"","title":"","desc":""}],"refs":[{"id":1,"ref":"Wikipedia contributors.
