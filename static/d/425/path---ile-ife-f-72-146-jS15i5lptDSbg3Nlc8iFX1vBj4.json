{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Ile-Ife was a powerful Yoruba kingdom dated to the 4th century BC. Yorubaland is the cultural region of the Yoruba people in West Africa. It spans the modern-day countries of Nigeria, Togo, and Benin.</p>\n<p>From the 12th to the 15th centuries, Ife flourished as a powerful, cosmopolitan and wealthy city-state in West Africa. The cities were fortresses, with high walls and gates. </p>\n<p>Ife was an influential centre of trade connected to extensive local and long-distance trade networks which enabled the region to prosper.</p>\n<p>Ile-Ife is known for its naturalistic bronze, stone, copper, brass and terracotta sculptures, which reached their peak of artistic expression between 1200 and 1400. </p>\n<p>Bronze and terracotta art created by this civilization are significant examples of naturalism in pre-colonial African art and are distinguished by their variations in regalia, facial marking patterns,and body proportions. Ancient Ife also was famous for its glass beads which have been found at sites as far away as Mali, Mauritania, and Ghana.</p>\n<p>After this period, production declined as political and economic power shifted to the nearby kingdom of Benin.</p>","fields":{"slug":"ile-ife"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ile-Ife","img":[{"name":"ile-ife_Yoruba-bronze-head.jpg","desc":"Yoruba Copper mask for King Obalufon, Ife, Nigeria c. 1300 C.E."},{"name":"ile-ife_Ife_Kings_Head.jpg","desc":"Bronze Head from Ife, probably a king and dated around 1300 C.E., in the British Museum."},{"name":"ile-ife_Afrikaabteilung_02.jpg","desc":"Terracotta head from Ife, probably a king, 12th to 15th Century C.E., in the Ethnological Museum of Berlin."},{"name":"ile-ife_Fragment_of_a_Head.jpg","desc":"Terracotta head representing oni or King of Ife, 12th to 16th century"}],"vid":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JNmCg3nNi1U"}],"url":[{"id":7,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ife","title":"Ife","desc":" Ife was created by Yoruba religion which accordingly was the order of the Supreme God Olodumare to Obatala, eventually falling into the hands of his brother Oduduwa which created turmoil between the two  Oduduwa created his own dynasty through his sons and daughters that became different rulers of many kingdoms...
