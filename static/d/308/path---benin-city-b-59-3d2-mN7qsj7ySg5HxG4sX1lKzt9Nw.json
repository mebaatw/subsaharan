{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Benin City, originally known as Edo, was once the capital of The Benin Empire. The city was made of hundreds of interlocked cities and villages laid out to form perfect fractals. The main streets had underground drainage made of a sunken impluvium with an outlet to carry away storm water. Metal lamps fuelled by palm oil provided street lighting  at night. </p>\n<p>The city was enclosed by massive walls made from earthworks longer than the Great Wall of China. The walls were built of a ditch and dike structure; the ditch dug to form an inner moat with the excavated earth used to form the exterior rampart.</p>\n<p>The Benin Walls were ravaged by the British in 1897 during what has come to be called the Punitive expedition. Scattered pieces of the structure remain in Edo, with the vast majority of them being used by the locals for building purposes. What remains of the wall itself continues to be torn down for real estate developments.[2] Fred Pearce wrote in New Scientist:</p>\n<p>They extend for some 16,000 km in all, in a mosaic of more than 500 interconnected settlement boundaries. They cover 2,510 sq. miles (6,500 square kilometres) and were all dug by the Edo people. In all, they are four times longer than the Great Wall of China, and consumed a hundred times more material than the Great Pyramid of Cheops. They took an estimated 150 million hours of digging to construct, and are perhaps the largest single archaeological phenomenon on the planet.[3]</p>\n<p>Ethnomathematician Ron Eglash has discussed the planned layout of the city using fractals as the basis, not only in the city itself and the villages but even in the rooms of houses. He commented that \"When Europeans first came to Africa, they considered the architecture very disorganised and thus primitive. It never occurred to them that the Africans might have been using a form of mathematics that they hadn’t even discovered yet.\"[4]</p>\n<p>The city was destroyed by British soldiers in 1897. </p>","fields":{"slug":"benin-city"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Benin City","img":[{"name":"benin-city_Ancient_Benin_city.jpg","desc":"Benin city in the 17th century"},{"name":"benin-city_Drawing.jpg","desc":"Drawing of Benin City made by an English officer, 1897"},{"name":"benin-city_streetview.jpg","desc":"View along a street in the royal quarter of Benin City, 1897.

It is divided into many magnificent palaces, houses, and apartments of the courtiers, and comprises beautiful and long square galleries, about as large as the Exchange at Amsterdam, but one larger than another, resting on wooden pillars, from top to bottom covered with cast copper, on which are engraved the pictures of their war exploits and battles...\""},{"id":4,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Benin","title":"Kingdom of Benin","desc":"The kingdom of Benin was a pre-colonial kingdom in what is now southern Nigeria.
