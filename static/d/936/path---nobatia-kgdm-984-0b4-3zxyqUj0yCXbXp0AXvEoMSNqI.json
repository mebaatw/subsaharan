{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Nobatia was a late antique kingdom in Lower Nubia. Together with the two other Nubian kingdoms, Makuria and Alodia, it succeeded the kingdom of Kush. After its establishment in around 400, Nobadia gradually expanded by defeating the Blemmyes in the north and incorporating the territory between the second and third Nile cataract in the south. In 543 it converted to Coptic Christianity.</p>\n<p>The kingdom of Nobatia had been founded in the former Meroitic province of Akine, which comprised large parts of Lower Nubia and is speculated to have been autonomous already before the ultimate fall of the Meroitic kingdom in the mid 4th century. While the Nobatae had been invited into the region from the Western Desert by the Roman Emperor Diocletian already in 297 AD, their kingdom becomes tangible only in around 400 AD. Early Nobatia is quite likely the same civilization that is known to archeologists as the Ballana culture. Eventually the Nobatae were successful in defeating the Blemmyes, and an inscription by Silko, \"Basiliskos\" of the Nobatae, claims to have driven the Blemmyes into the Eastern Desert. Around this time the Nobatian capital was established at Pakhoras (modern Faras); soon after, Nobatia converted to non-Chalcedonian Christianity.</p>\n<p>By 707, Nobatia had been annexed to its southern neighbor, Makuria. The circumstances of this merger are unknown. It is also unknown what happened to the royal Nobadian family. The merger most likely occurred before the Muslim conquest in 652, since the Arab histories speak of only one Christian state in Nubia and reached at least as far as Old Dongola. Nobatia seems to have maintained some autonomy in the new state. It was ruled by an eparch of Nobatia who was also titled the Domestikos of Pakhoras. These were originally appointed but seem to be dynastic in the later period. Some of their records have been found at Fort Ibrim, presenting a figure with a great deal of power. Nobatia՚s name is often given as al-Maris in Arabic histories. The eparchate of Nobadia remained an integral part of the kingdom of Makuria until the very end, as is confirmed by a document from 1463 mentioning an eparch named Teedderre.</p>\n<p>Archaeology from the pagan period confirms the relevance archery had for the Nubians and therefore also the Nobatians. The slightly reflexed longsbows, which are attested for Kushite mercenaries since the Middle Kingdom, were replaced by reflex composite bows during the Meroitic or post-Meroitic period, measuring around one meter and originally designed to be shot from horseback. One simple wooden self bow is known from an early Nobadian burial in Qustul. Furthermore, the archers wore thumb rings, measuring between three and four cm. Thus, Nubian archers would have employed a drawing technique very similar to the Persian and Chinese one, both of which also reliant on thumb rings.</p>\n<p>A weapon characteristic for the Nobadians was a type of short sword. It has a straight hollow-ground blade which was sharpened only on one edge and was therefore not designed to thrust, but to hack. Apart of said swords, there were also lances, some of them with large blades, as well as halberds.</p>\n<p>Nobadian warriors and their leadership made use of shields and body armour, most of it manufactured from leather.</p>\n<p>Read more: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobatia\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobatia</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"nobatia_kgdm"},"frontmatter":{"title":"kingdom of Nobatia","img":[{"name":"nobatia_kgdm_crown_from_Ballana_Tomb.jpg","desc":"Royal crown discovered in Ballana (5th century)"},{"name":"nobatia_kgdm_chamber_of_the_temple_of_Philae.jpg","desc":"Reliefs of the \"Ethiopian\" chamber inside the Isis temple of Philae, depicting pilgrims and priests from the south."},{"name":"nobatia_kgdm_warsztat_nubijsk.jpg","desc":"Early 7th century frieze fragment of the Faras cathedral."},{"name":"nobatia_kgdm_tomba_Q149.jpg","desc":"Quiver remains from Qustul, c. 400"},{"name":"nobatia_kgdm_Silko.jpg","desc":"Graffito from the Temple of Kalabsha (Talmis), depicting king Silko on horse back while being crowned by Nike."},{"name":"nobatia_kgdm_at_Faras_037.jpg","desc":"Eastern facade of the Faras cathedral."},{"name":"nobatia_kgdm_Faras_067.jpg","desc":"Northern nave.
