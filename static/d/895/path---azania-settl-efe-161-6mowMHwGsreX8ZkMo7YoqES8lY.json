{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Azania (Ancient Greek: Ἀζανία) is a name that has been applied to various parts of southeastern tropical Africa. In the Roman period and perhaps earlier, the toponym referred to a portion of the Southeast Africa coast extending from Kenya, to perhaps as far south as Tanzania. This area was inhabited by Southern Cushitic-speaking populations until the wave of Bantu expansion.</p>\n<p>Pliny the Elder mentions an \"Azanian Sea\" (N.H. 6.34) that began around the emporium of Adulis and stretched around the south coast of Africa. Later Western writers who mention Azania include Claudius Ptolemy (c. 100 – c. 170 CE) and Cosmas Indicopleustes (6th century CE).</p>\n<p>The 1st century AD Greek travelogue the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea first describes Azania based on its author's intimate knowledge of the area. Chapter 15 of the Periplus suggests that Azania could be the littoral area south of present-day Somalia (the \"Lesser and Greater Bluffs\", the \"Lesser and Greater Strands\", and the \"Seven Courses\").[4] Chapter 16 clearly describes the emporium of Rhapta, located south of the Puralean Islands at the end of the Seven Courses of Azania, as the \"southernmost market of Azania\". Subsequently, by the 10th century AD, these original \"Azanians\" had been replaced by early waves of Bantu settlers.</p>","fields":{"slug":"azania-settl"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Azania","img":[{"name":"","desc":""}],"vid":[],"url":[{"id":1,"url":"","title":"","desc":""}],"refs":[{"id":1,"ref":"Wikipedia contributors.
