{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The kingdom of Fazughli was a precolonial state in what is now southeastern Sudan and western Ethiopia. Oral traditions assert its establishment to refugees from the Nubian kingdom of Alodia, after its capital Soba had fallen to Arabs or the Funj in c.1500. Fazughli was famous for its gold. Centered around the mountainous region of Fazughli on the Blue Nile and serving as a buffer between the Funj sultanate and the Ethiopian empire, the kingdom lasted until its incorporation into the Funj sultanate in 1685.</p>\n<p>The kingdom of Fazughli was located between the sultanate of Sennar and the Ethiopian empire, serving as a buffer between these two states. Africanist Alessandro Triulzi describes the approximate extension of the kingdom as follows:</p>\n<p>to the east it included the Gumuz country between Gallabat and the Blue Nile, with its centre at Gubba; to the west it included the Burun country with its centre at Jebel Gule, whose realm was said to have extended as far south as Kaffa in southern Ethiopia, and to the south it included mostly the Bertha country along the gold-bearing Tumat valley down to Fadasi at the outskirts of the Oromo-inhabited territory.</p>\n<p>Its territory would have been inhabited predominantly by speakers of Eastern Sudanic languages. According to Spaulding, it maintained the Christian faith, at least among the ruling Alodian elite. According to him, this Alodian elite would become known as the Hamaj, but it also might be possible that it was in fact the bulk of the Fazughlian population that constituted the Hamaj.</p>\n<p>Read more: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Fazughli\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom<em>of</em>Fazughli</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"fazughli"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kingdom of Fazughli","img":[{"name":"","desc":""}],"vid":[],"url":[{"id":1,"url":"","title":"","desc":""}],"refs":[{"id":1,"ref":"Wikipedia contributors.
