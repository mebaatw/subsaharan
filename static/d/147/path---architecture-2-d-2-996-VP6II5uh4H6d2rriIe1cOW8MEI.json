These villages were roughly contemporary with the walled town of Jericho in Palestine.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3> Early Period</h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>Early Nubian architecture was found in the A-Group culture(c. 3800 BC to c. 3100 BC.). Early hubs of this civilization included Kubaniyya in the north and Buhen in the south, with Aswan, Sayala, Toshka and Qustul in between. The A-Group makers maintained commercial ties with the Ancient Egyptians.</p>\n<p>The A-Group makers left behind a number of cemeteries, with each necropolis containing around fifty graves. Most of what is known about this culture has been gleaned from these tombs, over 3,000 of which have been excavated. Two types of A-Group graves exist. One was oval in shape 0.8 metres (2 ft 7 in) deep. The second was oval in shape 1.3 metres (4 ft 3 in) deep with a deeper second chamber.[2]</p>\n<p>Excavations at an A-Group cemetery in Qustul yielded an old incense burner, which was adorned with Ancient Egyptian royal iconography. A brief description from the Oriental Institute follows:</p>\n<p><i>\"This incense burner is distinctively Nubian in form. Carved in the technique of Nubian rock art, it is decorated on the rim with typical Nubian designs. It was found in the tomb of a Nubian ruler at Qustul and incorporates images associated with Egyptian pharaohs: a procession of sacred boats, the White Crown of Upper Egypt, a falcon deity, and the palace facade called a serekh. It appears to represent a ritual that involved a royal procession by boat to a palace.</p>\n<p>The scenes depicted on the Qustul Incense Burner have excited considerable interest and discussion - why would seemingly Egyptian symbols have been used in Nubia?</p>\n<p>One interpretation is that Nubian A-Group rulers and early Egyptian pharaohs used related royal symbols. Similarities in rock art of A-Group Nubia and Upper Egypt support this position.</p>\n<p>Another view suggests that the decoration was carved by Nubians in imitation of Egyptian art and rituals. In this perspective, A-Group Nubian rulers would have emulated the symbols of Egyptian pharaohs, whose prestige and power were evident.\"[20]</i></p>\n<p>The A-Group culture came to an end around 3100 BC, when it was destroyed by the First Dynasty rulers of Egypt.</p>\n<p>The A-Group culture was followed later by the C-Group culture (2200-1500 BCE). Settlements consisted of round structures with stone floors. The C-Group culture had roots in sub-saharan African culture: </p>\n<p><i>\"Small circular houses with stone foundations, handmade ceramics with elaborate incised decoration, and graves covered with circular stone mounds are features that C-Group shared with earlier Nubian A-Group and Pre-Kerma cultures. But the importance of cattle in the C-Group, shown in its burial stelae, pottery, figurines, and rock drawings, also links it firmly to the African cattle cultures that began in the Neolithic and then spread across sub-Saharan Africa.\"[21]</i></p>\n<p>The C-Group culture also had deep ties with Egypt:</p>\n<p><i>\"C-Group cemeteries are found as far north as Hierakonpolis in southern Egypt, and Egyptians traveled and traded in Nubia. Many Nubians were soldiers in Egyptian armies. Nubian troops featured prominently in warfare during Egypt’s First Intermediate Period (about 2100 BC), a time of civil unrest. Egyptian traders and returning Nubian soldiers brought Egyptian goods including amulets, pots, and valuable gold and silver necklaces to Nubia. Though first ruled by Egypt and then by Kerma, C-Group culture retained its own distinctive customs for centuries. Later, C-Group traditions became less visible in archaeological remains as Nubians adopted Egyptian styles during the Egyptian New Kingdom occupation of Nubia (1550–1069 BC).\"[21]</i></p>\n<br/>\n<h3> <a href=\"/subsaharan/kerma-city\">Kerma</a> </h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>The C-Group culture was related to the Kerma Culture. Kerma was settled around 2400 BCE. It was a walled city containing a religious building, large circular dwelling, a palace, and well laid out roads. On the East side of the city, a funerary temple and chapel were laid out. It supported a population of 2,000. One of its most enduring structures was the <a href=\"https://www.ancient.eu/image/1111/western-deffufa-temple-kerma/\">Deffufa</a>, a mud brick temple where ceremonies were performed on top.[4]</p>\n<p>The deffufa is a unique structure in Nubian Architecture. Three known deffufas exist: the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerma#/media/File:Western_Deffufa_-_Kerma.jpg\">Western Deffufa</a> at Kerma, an <a href=\"http://www.traveladventures.org/continents/africa/kerma-deffufas04.html\">Eastern Deffufa</a>, and a third, little-known deffufa. The Western Deffufa is 50 by 25 metres (164 by 82 ft). It is 18 metres (59 ft) tall and comprises three stories. It was surrounded by a boundary wall. Inside were chambers connected by passageways.[5]</p>\n<p>The Eastern Deffufa lies 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) east of the Western Deffufa. The Eastern Deffufa is shorter than the Western Deffufa, just two stories high. It is considered a funerary chapel, being surrounded by 30,000 tumuli or graves. It has two columned halls. The walls are decorated with portraiture of animal in color schemes of red, blue, yellow, and black and stone laid floors. Exterior walls were layered with stone. The third deffufa is of similar structure as the Eastern Deffufa.[5][6]</p>\n<p>The Kerma graves are distinct. They are circular pits covered with white or black pebbles in a circular mound. Four huge graves in the southern part of the site exist. They lie in rows surrounded by smaller graves. The diameter is 9 metres (30 ft), covered with circular mounds of white and black desert pebbles 3 metres (9.8 ft) high. Underneath exists a complex structure. A pathway running along the diameter is laid with mud walls, supporting the above mound. The mud walls seemed to have been once decorated. The pathway goes to a chamber with a Nubian vault and a wooden door where the king is buried. The king's bed is elaborate with stone carved legs. The vaulted chamber lies in the center of the structure. It is estimated 300 humans and 1000 cattle were probably sacrificed with the king to accompany him in the after-life.[7]</p>\n<br/>\n<h3><a href=\"/subsaharan/kush_kngdm\">Kush</a> and <a href=\"/subsaharan/napata-nubia\">Napata</a></h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>Between 1500-1085 BCE, Egyptian conquest and domination of Nubia was achieved. This conquest brought about the Napatan Phase of Nubian history, the birth of the Kingdom of Kush. Kush was immensely influenced by Egypt and eventually conquered it. During this phase we see the building of numerous pyramids and temples.</p>\n<p>Of much spiritual significance to Nubian pharaohs was <a href=\"/subsaharan/jebel-barkal\">Jebel Barkal</a>. Nubian pharaohs received legitimacy from the site. They held pharaonic coronation and consulted its oracle. It was thought to be the dwelling place of the deity Amun. Temples for Mut, Hathor, and Bes are also present. Thirteen temples and three palaces have been excavated.</p>\n<p>The city of Napata has not been fully excavated. Some of the temples were started by various pharaohs and were added on by succeeding pharaohs, beginning with Egyptian pharaohs. Reisner excavated <a href=\"/subsaharan/jebel-barkal\">Jebel Barkal</a>, labeling its monuments B for Barkal. Some are as follows: B200 (temple of Taharqa), B300 (Taharqa's other <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Mut,_Jebel_Barkal\">temple of Mut</a>, Hathor and Bes), B500 (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Amun,_Jebel_Barkal\">temple of Amun</a>), B501 (outer court), B502 (hypostyle hall), B700 (temple), B800sub (temple of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alara_of_Nubia\">Alara of Nubia</a>), B1200 (palace). Psamtik II of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt sacked the region in 593 BCE, destroying all Nubian statues in B500.[8]</p>\n<p>Nubian pyramids were constructed on three major sites: <a href=\"/subsaharan/el-kurru\">El-Kurru</a>, <a href=\"/subsaharan/nuri-nubia\">Nuri</a>, and <a href=\"/subsaharan/meroe-nubia\">Meroë</a>. More pyramids were constructed and for the longest time in Nubia than in Egypt. Nubia contains 223 pyramids. They were smaller than Egyptian pyramids. Nubian pyramids were for kings and queens. The general construction of Nubian pyramids consisted of steep walls, a chapel facing East, stairway facing East, and a chamber access via the stairway.[9][10]</p>\n<p><a href=\"/subsaharan/el-kurru\">El-Kurru</a> was the first major site. It is located 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) south from <a href=\"/subsaharan/jebel-barkal\">Jebel Barkal</a>. It was made of sandstone. It range from 10 to 30 metres (33 to 98 ft) in height. About 10 pharaohs and 14 queens were buried at <a href=\"/subsaharan/el-kurru\">El-Kurru</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/subsaharan/nuri-nubia\">Nuri</a> was another important pyramid site, 6 miles northeast of <a href=\"/subsaharan/jebel-barkal\">Jebel Barkal</a>. It housed the tombs of 20 pharaohs and 54 queens. The pharaoh's pyramids range from 39.5 to 65 metres (130 to 213 ft) in height. The queen's pyramids are 9 to 17 metres (30 to 56 ft). The tombs were cut out of bedrock. The pharaoh's chamber contained three interconnecting chambers. The queen's contain two interconnecting chambers.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3> <a href=\"/subsaharan/meroe-nubia\">Meroë</a></h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>The third Nubian Pyramid site Meroë is considered to be the largest archaeological site in the world. It contains more Nubian Pyramids than any other site.</p>\n<p>The ancient Nubians established a system of geometry including early versions of sun clocks.[11][12] Many are located at the sites of Meroë. During the Meroitic period in Nubian history the ancient Nubians used a trigonometric methodology similar to the Egyptians.[13]</p>\n<br/>\n<h3>Christian Nubia</h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>The Christianization of Nubia began in the 6th century AD. Its most representative architecture are churches. They are based on Byzantium Basilicas. The structures are relatively small and made of mud bricks. The church is rectangular in shape with North and South isles. Columns are used to divide the nave. On the East side is the apse. The altar stood in front of the apse. The area between the altar and apse was called the Haikal. At the West, was a tower or upper room also in the South corner and North corner. Doors were in the North and South walls. A few church survived which were more elaborate, were built of stone, two in Faras and the Ghazail Church.</p>\n<p>Church painting with biblical themes were extensive but few survived. The best surviving church painting were on the Rivergate Church of Faras and the Church of Ab El Qadir.</p>\n<p>Vernacular architecture of the Christian period is scarce. Architecture of Soba is the only one that has been excavated . The structures are of sun dried bricks, same as present day Sudan, except for an arch.[14][15]</p>\n<p>One prominent feature of Nubian churches are vaults(dome) made out of mud-bricks. The mud-brick structure was revived by Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy after rediscovering the technique in the Nubian village of Abu al-Riche . The technology is advocated by environmentalist as environmentally friendly and sustainable, since it makes use of pure earth without the need of timber.[16]</p>\n<p>One of the key advantages of the Nubian vault is that it can be built without any support or shuttering. The earth bricks are laid leaning at a slight slope against the gable walls in a length-wise vault, as in this photo of a building from the ruins of Ayn Asil in Egypt. The same principle can be used to build domes, as in the example below from Cameroon.</p>\n<p>These environmentally sound, comfortable, and aesthetic buildings require neither imported sheet metal for the roofing, nor expensive and increasingly rare timber beams.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3>Islamic Nubia</h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>The conversion to Islam was a slow, gradual process, with almost 600 years of resistance. Most of the architecture of the period are mosques built of mud-bricks. One of the first attempt at conquest was by Egyptian-Nubian, Ibn Abi Sarh. Ibn Abi Sarh was a Muslim leader who tried to conquer all Nubia in the 8th century AD. It was almost a complete failure. An agreement called the Baqt, shaped Egyptian-Nubian relations for six centuries, and permitted the construction of a mosque in the Nubian capital of Dongola for Muslim travelers. By the middle of the 14th century, Nubia had been converted to Islam. The royal Church of Dongola was converted into a mosque. Numerous other churches were converted to mosque.[17]</p>\n<p>Graves were simple pits, with bodies pointing to Mecca. Some of the unique structures were the gubbas, graves reserved for Muslim saints. They were whitewashed domes made of adobe bricks.[18]</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"4adaa99a-3786-5ec3-a535-458a2e88bee4","frontmatter":{"country":"Mauritania","title":"Dhar Tichitt","date":"4000 BP"},"fields":{"slug":"dhar-tichitt"},"excerpt":"Dhar Tichitt is a Neolithic archaeological site located in the southwestern region of the Sahara Desert, in Mauritania.

It is one of several settlement locations along the sandstone cliffs in the area. The cliffs were inhabited by pastoralists starting at around 4000 BP and lasted to around 2300 BP before present (BP)[1]. About 500 stone settlements are found in the region. In addition to herding livestock, its inhabitants fished and grew millet.</p>\n<p>The climate of the Dhar Tichitt region today is very arid and hot. However, this was not always the case. The area was much more temperate during a humid phase referred to as the Nouakchottian, c. 5000-3000 BP. During this time, the region experienced two different seasons per year, a dry season and a shorter rainy season. Around 2500 BP, the climate began to change, and it became too dry for people to stay in the area.[1]</p>\n<p>The faunal evidence at the Dhar Tichitt area is highly diverse. Cattle, sheep, and goats are the most common faunal remains. Other faunal remains include crocodile, hippopotamus, ostrich, gazelle, fish, and very few representative bones of other animals. Given the amount of faunal remains that are from domesticated animals it is safe to say that this was a pastoralist society.</p>\n<p>The botanical remains at the site reveal that the pastoralists society practiced some cultivation.

These beams also act as scaffolding for reworking, which is done at regular intervals, and involves the local community. The earliest examples of Sudano-Sahelian style probably come from Jenné-Jeno around 250 BC, where the first evidence of permanent mudbrick architecture in the region is found.[1]</p>\n<br/>\n<h3>Difference between Savannah and Sahelian styles</h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>The earthen architecture in the Sahel zone region is noticeably different from the building style in the neighboring savannah. The \"old Sudanese\" cultivators of the savannah built their compounds out of several cone-roofed houses. This was primarily an urban building style, associated with centres of trade and wealth, characterised by cubic buildings with terraced roofs comprise the typical style.</p>\n<p>They lend a characteristic appearance to the close-built villages and cities. Large buildings such as mosques, representative residential and youth houses stand out in the distance. They are landmarks in a flat landscape that point to a complex society of farmers, craftsmen and merchants with a religious and political upper class.</p>\n<p>With the expansion of Sahelian kingdoms south to the rural areas in the savannas (inhabited by culturally or ethnically similar groups to those in the Sahel), the Sudano-Sahelian style was reserved for mosques, palaces, the houses of nobility or townsfolk (as is evident in the Gur-Voltaic style), whereas among commonfolk, there was a mix between either typically distinct Sudano-Sahelian styles for wealthier families, and older African roundhut styles for rural villages and family compounds.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3>Substyles</h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>The Sudano-Sahelian architectural style itself can be broken down into four smaller sub-styles that are typical of different ethnic groups in the region. The examples used here illustrate the construction of mosques as well as palaces, as the architectural style is concentrated around inland Muslim populations.</p>\n<p>As with the people, many of these styles cross-pollinate and produce buildings with shared features. Any one of these styles is not exclusive to one particular modern countries borders, but are linked to the ethnicity of its builders or surrounding populations. For example, a Malian migrant community in traditionally Gur area may build in the style characteristic of their ancestral homeland, while neighbouring Gur buildings are built in the local style. These styles include: </p>\n<h3>Malian Architecture</h3>\n<p>The architecture of Mali comprises adobe buildings such as <a href=\"/Djenne-Djenno/\">The Great Mosque of Djenne</a> or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Timbuktu\">University of Timbuktu</a>. It can be found all over the Sahel region. Malian architecture developed during the <a href=\"/ghana-empire\">Ghana Empire</a> which founded most of Mali's great cities. They then flourished in West Africa's two greatest civilisations the <a href=\"/mali_empire\">Mali Empire</a> and the <a href=\"/songhai\">Songhai Empire</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/timbuktu-city\">Timbuktu</a> has many adobe and mud brick buildings but the most famous is the University. The masajids (mosques) of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankore_Madrasah\">Sankore</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djinguereber_Mosque\">Djinguereber</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kani-Kombole\">Kani-Kombole Mosque</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidi_Yahya_Mosque\">Sidi Yahya</a> were the centres of learning in medieval <a href=\"/mali_empire\">Mali</a> and produced some of the most famous works in Africa, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbuktu_Manuscripts\">Timbuktu Manuscripts</a>.\n<br>\n<br/>    </p>\n<h3>Fortress style</h3>\n<p>Fortress style is predominantly used by the Zarma peoples of northern Nigeria and Niger, Hausa-Fulani, Tuareg and Arab mixed communities in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agadez\">Agadez</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanuri_people\">Kanuri</a> people of Lake Chad, and <a href=\"/songhai\">Songhai</a> of northeastern Mali. Military aspect to construction of high protective compound walls built around a central courtyard. Minaret is the only structure with support beams showing. Characterized by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankore_Madrasah\">Sankore Mosque</a> of Timbuktu, the tomb of Askia in <a href=\"/gao_empire\">Gao</a> Mali, and the Agadez mosque of northern Niger.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3> Hausa Architecture </h3>\n<p>Hausa architecture (known as Tubali in the Hausa language) is a distinct sub-style among the various Sudano-Sahelian architectural styles predominant in North and Northwestern Nigeria, Niger, Eastern Burkina Faso, Northern Benin, and found throughout the Sahel-geographic band stretching from Senegal and Mauritania in the West to Sudan in the east.</p>\n<p>Hausa buildings are characterized by the use of dry mud bricks in cubic structures, multi-storied buildings for the social elite, the use of parapets related to their military/fortress building past, and traditional white stucco and plaster for house fronts. At times the facades may be decorated with various abstract relief designs, sometimes painted in vivid colours to convey information about the occupant.</p>\n<p>Examples include the architecture of the <a href=\"https://www.akdn.org/architecture/project/yaama-mosque\">Yamma Mosque</a> and old town of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinder\">Zinder</a>, The Hausa quarter of Agadez Niger, the Gidan Rumfa of <a href=\"/kano-state\">Kano</a>, and various Hausa districts across West Africa.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3> Volta basin</h3>\n<p>Volta basin of the Gur and Manden groups of Burkina Faso, northern Ghana and northern Cote d'Ivoire. The most conservative of the three styles. A single courtyard, characterized by high white and black painted walls, inward curved turrets supporting an exterior wall, and a larger turret nearer the center. Characterized by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larabanga\">Larabanga</a> mosque of Ghana and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobo-Dioulasso\">Bobo-Dioulasso</a> Grand Mosque.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3>Sudano-Sahelian Styles by Region</h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>At <a href=\"/koumbi-saleh\">Kumbi Saleh</a>, locals lived in dome-shaped dwellings in the king's section of the city, surrounded by a great enclosure. Traders lived in stone houses in a section which possessed 12 beautiful mosques (as described by al-Bakri), one of which was for Friday prayer.[16] The king is said to have owned several mansions, one of which was sixty-six feet long and forty-two feet wide, contained seven rooms, was two stories high, and had a staircase, with paintings on the walls and chambers filled with sculpture.</p>\n<p>Sahelian architecture initially grew from the two cities of Djenné and Timbuktu. The Sankore Mosque, constructed from mud on timber, was similar in style to the Great Mosque of Djenné.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/ashanti\">Ashanti</a> architecture from Ghana is perhaps best known from the reconstruction at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumasi\">Kumasi</a>. Its key features are courtyard-based buildings, and walls with striking reliefs in brightly painted mud plaster. An example of a shrine can be seen at Bawjiase in Ghana. Four rectangular rooms, constructed from wattle and daub, lie around a courtyard. Animal designs mark the walls, and palm leaves cut to a tiered shape provide the roof.</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"a4d3f772-2718-5e51-8362-d3270fb0a782","frontmatter":{"country":"Mali","title":"Djenné-Djenno","date":""},"fields":{"slug":"Djenne-Djenno"},"excerpt":"Djenné-Djenno (also Jenne-Jeno) is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the Niger River Valley in the country of Mali.

This archaeological site is believed to have been involved in long distance trade and possibly the domestication of African rice. The site is known to have been occupied from 250 B.C. to 900 A.D. The city is believed to have been abandoned and moved where the current city is located due to the spread of Islam and the building of the Great Mosque of Djenné. </p>\n<p>This first occupation of the site (which lasted from 250 B.C. to A.D. 50) is known as Phase I and is some of the earliest evidence for iron production in sub-Saharan Africa. Geomorphological data show that the region consisted mostly of swampland at that time. Groups only began permanently occupying the area after a dry episode in which annual flooding receded and decreased the size of the swamps. Faunal remains at the site from this occupation have included catfish and Nile perch but mostly cow, leading to the assumption that this first phase might be associated with hunter-gatherer or pastoral modes of subsistence. During this period there is no evidence for rice production, however it is believed that these people might have been rice producers, even though no definitive evidence has been discovered yet.</p>\n<p>Phase II is defined by a larger population and definitive evidence for the mass production of rice. The borders of the site expanded during this period (possibly covering 100,000 square meters or more), as well as the presence of permanent mud brick architecture. </p>\n<p>Phase III dates from about A.D. 300 to A.D. 900 and is believed to have an even higher population based on crowded cemeteries. The site also has evidence for a more intensive occupation through deep house deposits, possibly from multiple generations.</p>\n<p>Djenné-Djenno is famous for its terracotta figurines which depict humans and animals including snakes and horses. Throughout the site's occupations, pottery fragments are abundant. Some of the more interesting clay artifacts begin in Phase II with terra-cotta statuettes and representations of humans and animals on pottery. These statuettes are important to the understanding of Phase II because along with this art, the first evidence for large-scale rice cultivation and population rise. All of these attributes are commonly associated with complex, state-level societies. It is believed that these artifacts posed ritual function as opposed to a domestic function. Some of these clay figurines are similar to those made by modern Fulani pastoralists for children.</p>\n<p>Evidence for domestic cow, sheep and goat cultivation is present at the site. </p>\n<p>The land surrounding Djenné-Djenno lent itself to such high-yielding crops due to its mixture of highland and floodplain soils at different elevations that allowed floodwater farming of rice. Moreover, the Djenné-Djenno site lies in close proximity to dune landscape, which allows for necessary recreation needed for keeping cattle in floodplain environments. Overall, the diversified sources of food provided food security that allowed for permanent settlement in a region of volatile climate. It is believed that this food production, especially that of African rice, was one of the main contributors to population rise in the city of Djenné-Djenno and was widely exported to nearby centers (including Timbuktu).</p>\n<p>It is suspected that Djenné-Djenno grew to such a vast size as a result of regional and local trade. Archaeological evidence supports that Djenné-Djenno was part of a pre-Arab trans-Saharan trade network. Glass beads found at the site have been dated to as early as the third century BC and appear to originate from Asia to the Mediterranean Near East. Copper ornaments have also been found in early Phase II deposits, which shows these trade networks date to earlier than previously thought. These discoveries lend support to the existence of sporadic contacts between West and North Africa throughout the first millennium AD.</p>\n<p>Since there is no evidence for a fourth phase, it is expected that towards the end of Phase III the city experienced a slow decline in population and eventually a total abandonment. However, very little is known about why this decline happened, and more research is needed.</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"0664a23e-75fb-5d72-827a-55a438912949","frontmatter":{"country":"Eritrea","title":"Matara","date":""},"fields":{"slug":"matara_city"},"excerpt":"Matara (Metera) is an archaeological site in Eritrea.

Aksum became a major player on the commercial route between the Roman Empire and Ancient India.

Makuria originally covered the area along the Nile River from the Third Cataract to somewhere south of Abu Hamad as well as parts of northern Kordofan. Its capital was Dongola (Old Nubian: Tungul), and the kingdom is sometimes known by the name of its capital.</p>\n<p>By the end of the 6th century, it had converted to Christianity, but in the 7th century, Egypt was conquered by the Islamic armies. Makuria was one of the few states in the world to repulse Muslim conquests led by the Rashidun Caliphate when they defeated an Arab army at the First Battle of Dongola in 642. The Arabs had taken Egypt in 641, and the jihad soon turned south. Makuria repeated the feat in 652 at the Second Battle of Dongola. Arab writers noted the Makurians' skill as archers in both battles. One of the few major defeats suffered by an Arab army in the first century of Islamic expansion, it led to an unprecedented agreement: the bakt. This treaty guaranteed peaceful relations between the two sides. The Nubians agreed to give Arab traders more privileges of trade in addition to a share in their slave trading, while the Egyptians may have been obliged to send manufactured goods south.</p>\n<p>Makuria expanded by annexing its northern neighbor Nobatia, a process which would have occurred at some point after the Sasanian conquest of Egypt, but was completed until the reign of King Merkurios. It also maintained close dynastic ties with the kingdom of Alodia to the south. The period from the 9th to 11th century saw the peak of Makuria's cultural development: new monumental buildings were erected, arts like wall paintings and finely crafted and decorated pottery flourished and Nubian grew to become the prevalent written language.</p>\n<p>One of the most important discoveries of the rushed work prior to the flooding of Lower Nubia was the Cathedral of Faras. This large building had been completely filled with sand preserving a series of magnificent paintings. Similar, but less well preserved, paintings have been found at several other sites in Makuria, including palaces and private homes, giving an overall impression of Makurian art. The style and content was heavily influenced by Byzantine art, and also showed influence from Egyptian Coptic art and from Palestine. Mainly religious in nature, it depicts many of the standard Christian scenes. Also illustrated are a number of Makurian kings and bishops, with noticeably darker skin than the Biblical figures.</p>\n<p>Women enjoyed a high social standing. The matrilineal succession gave the queen mother and the sister of the current king as forthcoming queen mother great political relevance. Women had access to education and there is evidence that, like in Byzantine Egypt, female scribes existed. Private land tenure was open to both men and women, meaning that both could own, buy and sell land. Transfers of land from mother to daughter were common. </p>\n<p>The main economic activity in Makuria was agriculture, with farmers growing several crops a year of barley, millet, and dates. One important technological advance was the saqiya, an oxen-powered water wheel, that was introduced in the Roman period and helped increase yields and population density. Settlement patterns indicate that land was divided into individual plots rather than as in a manorial system. The peasants lived in small villages composed of clustered houses of sun-dried brick.</p>\n<p>Important industries included the production of pottery, based at Faras, and weaving based at Dongola. Smaller local industries include leatherworking, metalworking, and the widespread production of baskets, mats, and sandals from palm fibre. Also important was the gold mined in the Red Sea Hills to the east of Makuria. Cattle was of great economic importance. </p>\n<p>Increased aggression from Egypt, internal discord, bedouin incursions and possibly the plague and the shift of trade routes led to the state's decline in the 13th and 14th century. Due to a civil war in 1365, the kingdom was reduced to a rump state that lost much of its southern territories, including Dongola. It had disappeared by the 1560s, when the Ottoman occupied Lower Nubia. Nubia was subsequently Islamized, while the Nubians living upstream of Al Dabbah and in Kordofan were also Arabized.</p>\n<p>Read more:\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makuria\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makuria</a></p>"}},{"node":{"id":"aa62c08d-f6ce-531c-a3be-457f6caaa262","frontmatter":{"country":"Tanzania","title":"Kilwa Kisiwani","date":"700 CE. - 1400 CE"},"fields":{"slug":"kilwa-kswni"},"excerpt":"Kilwa Kisiwani is an archaeological city-state located on an Indian Ocean island off the southern coast of present-day Tanzania in eastern Africa.

To its south lies Adababay, the market place of Gondar, where imperial proclamations were made, troops presented, and criminals executed; it is currently a city park.</p>\n<p>Read more:\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasil_Ghebbi\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasil_Ghebbi</a></p>"}},{"node":{"id":"0be24e90-a947-5e5e-88e6-238f665386c1","frontmatter":{"country":"Zimbabwe","title":"The Rozvi Empire","date":"1660–1866"},"fields":{"slug":"rozvi_empire"},"excerpt":"The Rozvi Empire (1684–1834) was established on the Zimbabwean Plateau by Changamire Dombo.

They drove the Portuguese off the central plateau, and the Europeans retained only a nominal presence at one of the fair-towns in the eastern highlands.</p>\n<p>The Rozvi chiefs revived the tradition of building in stone and constructed impressive cities, now known as 'zimbabwes', throughout the southwest. Polychrome pottery was also emblematic of its culture. The Rozvi empire had many economic branches but agriculture was its backbone. They planted crops such as sorghum and millet and the state depended heavily on subsistence farming. Livestock was also another important agricultural branch. They kept animals such as sheep, goats, cattle and chickens; those with many livestock were considered rich and were accorded very high economic status within the society. Trade was another important economic activity and the Rozvi practiced both internal and external trade. From foreign traders they obtained imported goods such as guns, salt, beads and sea shells; in return they bartered ivory, copper and gold. Mining was another major branch and was done by males. The warriors were armed with spears, bows and arrows when they raided others or defended their state.</p>\n<p>Its warriors were known to be violent; this earned them the name rozvi, meaning plunders or destroyers. They became the most powerful fighting force in the whole of Zimbabwe.</p>\n<p>Records from the Portuguese show that the Rozvi were sophisticated military strategists. They were noted for using the cow-horn formation years before the great Zulu leader Shaka adopted it in the 19th century. Armed with spears, bows and arrows, the aggressive Rozvi took over the Zimbabwe plateau.</p>\n<p>Source:\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rozwi_Empire\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rozwi_Empire</a></p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"type":"*Architecture*","types":"Architecture"}}
