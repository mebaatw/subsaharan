{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Alodia, also known as Alwa (Greek: Aρογα, Aroua; Arabic:Alwa) was a medieval Nubian kingdom in what is now central and southern Sudan. Its capital was the city of Soba located near modern-day Khartoum at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile.</p>\n<p>Founded some time after the fall of the ancient kingdom of Kush in around 350, Alodia is first mentioned in historical records in 569. It converted to Coptic Christianity in 580, the last of the three Nubian kingdoms to convert, the other two being Nobadia and Makuria. It possibly reached its peak during the 9th–12th centuries when it is recorded to have controlled much of central and southern Sudan, exceeding its northern neighbor, Makuria, with which it maintained close dynastic ties, in size, power and economic prosperity. This wide, multicultural empire was ruled by a powerful king and provincial governors appointed by him. The capital Soba, being described as a town of \"extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens\", prospored as a trading hub with goods arriving from Makuria, the Middle East, western Africa, India and even China. Nubian and Greek literacy flourished.</p>\n<p>Based on archaeological evidence it has been suggested that Alodia's capital Soba underwent its peak of development between the 9th to 12th centuries. Monumental structures, have been unearthed in the capital Soba.  The discoveries include several churches, a palace, cemeteries and numerous small finds.</p>\n<p>In the mid 10th century, Alodia was visited by the traveller and historian Ibn Hawqal, resulting in the most comprehensive known account of the kingdom. He describes the geography and people of Alodia in considerable detail, giving the impression of a large, polyethnic state. He also notes its prosperity, having an \"uninterrupted chain of villages and a continuous strip of cultivated lands\".</p>\n<p>From the 12th and especially the 13th century Alodia was declining possibly because of invasions from the south, droughts and a shift of trade routes. The 14th century saw the arrival of both the plague and bedouin tribes migrating into the upper Nile valley. By around 1500 Soba had fallen to either Arabs or the Funj, likely marking the end of Alodia, although some Sudanese oral traditions claimed that it survived in the form of the kingdom of Fazughli within the Ethiopian-Sudanese borderlands.</p>\n<p>Read more:\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alodia\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alodia</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"alodia-kngdm"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Alodia","img":[{"name":"alodia-kngdm_Soba_East.jpg","desc":"Column remains of the \"Mound C\"-church, Soba"},{"name":"alodia-kngdm_king.jpg","desc":"Kushite bronze figurine, 1st century BC.
