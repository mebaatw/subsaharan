{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The Ghana Empire (c. 700 until c. 1240), properly known as Wagadou (Ghana or Ga'na being the title of its ruler), was located in the area of present-day southeastern Mauritania and western Mali. It is not geographically realted to Modern Ghana. Complex societies based on trans-Saharan trade with salt and gold had existed in the region since ancient times, but the introduction of the camel to the western Sahara in the 3rd century A.D. opened the way to great changes in the area that became the Ghana Empire. By the time of the Muslim conquest of North Africa in the 7th century the camel had changed the ancient, more irregular trade routes into a trade network running from Morocco to the Niger river. The Ghana Empire grew rich from this increased trans-Saharan trade in gold and salt, allowing for larger urban centres to develop. The traffic furthermore encouraged territorial expansion to gain control over the different trade-routes.</p>\n<p>The early history of Ghana is unknown. The Neolithic site of Dhar Tichitt in this area was settled by agropastoral communities around 2000 BC. Their settlements were generally situated on the cliffs and included stone building. These are the oldest surviving archaeological settlements in West Africa and the oldest of all stone base settlements south of the Sahara. They are thought to have been built by the Soninke people and were possibly the precursor of the Ghana empire. The area was abandoned around 500 BC probably because of the onset of more arid conditions. Hundreds of rock art images have been discovered, depicting various animals and hunting scenes. Archaeologists including P.J. Munson, Augustin F.C. Holl, and S. Amblard have found some evidence that millet was farmed seasonally as early as 2000 BC.</p>\n<p> There is evidence that North Africa had begun importing gold from West Africa before the Arab conquest in the middle of the seventh century. The earliest author to mention Ghana is the Persian astronomer Ibrahim al-Fazari who, writing at the end of the eighth century, refers to \"the territory of Ghana, the land of gold\". The Ghana Empire lay in the Sahel region to the north of the West African gold fields and was able to profit from controlling the trans-Saharan gold trade. </p>\n<p>In the 11th century the Cordoban scholar Abuof travelled to the region and gave a detailed description of the kingdom. He claimed that the Ghana could \"put 200,000 men into the field, more than 40,000 of them archers\", and noted they had cavalry forces as well.</p>\n<p>The archaeological ruins at Koumbi Saleh show remanents of the Ghana Emprie. Koumbi Saleh was a Muslim town with a strong Maghreb connection. The houses were constructed from local stone (schist) using banco rather than mortar. From the quantity of debris it is likely that some of the buildings had more than one storey. The rooms were quite narrow, probably due to the absence of large trees to provide long rafters to support the ceilings. The houses were densely packed together and separated by narrow streets. In contrast a wide avenue, up to 12 m in width, ran in an east-west direction across the town. At the western end lay an open site that was probably used as a marketplace. The main mosque was centrally placed on the avenue. It measured approximately 46 m east to west and 23 m north to south. </p>\n<p>As the empire declined it finally became a vassal of the rising Mali Empire at some point in the 13th century. When the Gold Coast in 1957 became the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to regain its independence from colonial rule, it renamed itself in honor of the long-gone empire.</p>","fields":{"slug":"ghana-empire"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ghana Empire","img":[{"name":"ghana-empire_kimbusaleh.jpg","desc":"The empire’s capital Koumbi Saleh on the rim of the Sahara desert."},{"name":"ghana-empire_kumbi.jpg","desc":"Empire of Ancient Ghana"},{"name":"ghana-empire_ruins2.jpg","desc":"Ruins of Kumbi Saleh, ancient capital of the Ghana Empire"},{"name":"ghana-empire_tunka.jpg","desc":"Tunka Manin, the last ruler of ancient Ghana Empire before its tragic fall"},{"name":"","desc":""}],"vid":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ADOSXAUS8us"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3x-IwaVhnmo"},{"url":""}],"url":[{"id":7,"url":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-african-history/article/archaeology-and-the-prehistoric-origins-of-the-ghana-empire/703B6E93A35E4F4D46390E74EC6E8D5F","title":"Archaeology and the prehistoric origins of the Ghana empire","desc":"Archaeological investigations in southern Mauretania have revealed a wealth of rather spectacular stone masonry villages which were occupied by prehistoric cultivators as early as 1000 B.C. It is argued that the inhabitants of these villages were Negro and very probably Soninke, and that the basic elements of their culture had developed without major influences from outside the area. The apparent sophistication and complexity of this cultural manifestation, combined with the close fit of developments in this area with Carneiro's theory of state formation, suggests that this prehistoric complex represented at least a powerful chiefdom which embodied many of the characteristics of subsequent West African states. The first demonstrable outside influences in the area began about 600 B.C. with the arrival of Libyco-Berbers from North Africa. Rather than causing still further cultural advances, the initial effect of this contact was the collapse of this sociopolitical organization. But with subsequent adjustment, plus the potential from trans-Saharan trade carried out by the North Africans, the basic, pre-existing pattern re-emerged, resulting eventually in a second and much more powerful African political organization in this area – the Ghana Empire."},{"id":3,"url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/4chapter1.shtml","title":"Ancient Ghana","desc":"Despite its name, the old Empire of Ghana is not geographically, ethnically, or in any other way, related to modern Ghana.
