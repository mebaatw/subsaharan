Later Western writers who mention Azania include Claudius Ptolemy (c. 100 – c. 170 CE) and Cosmas Indicopleustes (6th century CE).</p>\n<p>The 1st century AD Greek travelogue the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea first describes Azania based on its author's intimate knowledge of the area. Chapter 15 of the Periplus suggests that Azania could be the littoral area south of present-day Somalia (the \"Lesser and Greater Bluffs\", the \"Lesser and Greater Strands\", and the \"Seven Courses\").[4] Chapter 16 clearly describes the emporium of Rhapta, located south of the Puralean Islands at the end of the Seven Courses of Azania, as the \"southernmost market of Azania\". Subsequently, by the 10th century AD, these original \"Azanians\" had been replaced by early waves of Bantu settlers.</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"7e83ddae-c7e3-59b2-b20d-f72afc00f43d","frontmatter":{"country":"NA","title":"","date":""},"fields":{"slug":"markdown-template"},"excerpt":"country should be NA if its a subtitle\ncountries should include all the countries in the region.\nsort should be number\ntypes and type like country and countries vid:  \n       {url:  '', title: ''}\n     refs:  \n     {id: 1,  ref: '', url: ''}\n    ","timeToRead":1,"html":"<p>country should be NA if its a subtitle\ncountries should include all the countries in the region.\nsort should be number\ntypes and type like country and countries</p>\n<p>vid: [\n{url:  '', title: ''}\n]</p>\n<p>refs: [\n{id: 1,  ref: '', url: ''}\n]</p>\n<div class=\"mw-parser-output\">\n</div>\n<h3>\n    <span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_history\">\n        Early history\n    </span>\n</h3>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"type":"*NA*","types":"Architecture"}}
