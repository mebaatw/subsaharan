{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The Kerma culture or Kerma kingdom was an early civilization centered in Kerma (also known as Dukki Gel), Sudan. Kerma was the capital city of the Kerma culture.  It was a large urban center that was built around a large adobe temple known as the Western Deffufa.</p>\n<p>The Kerma culture flourished from around 2500 BCE to 1500 BCE in ancient Nubia, located in Upper Egypt and northern Sudan. </p>\n<p>The polity seems to have been one of a number of Nile Valley states during the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. In the Kingdom of Kerma's latest phase, lasting from about 1700â€“1500 BCE, it absorbed the Sudanese kingdom of Sai and became a sizable, populous empire rivaling Egypt. Around 1500 BCE, it was absorbed into the New Kingdom of Egypt, but rebellions continued for centuries. By the eleventh century BCE, the more-Egyptianized Kingdom of Kush emerged, possibly from Kerma, and regained the region's independence from Egypt.</p>\n<p>The primary site of Kerma that forms the heart of the Kingdom of Kerma includes both an extensive town and a cemetery consisting of large tumuli (a mound of earth and stones raised over a grave or graves). The level of affluence at the site demonstrated the power of the Kingdom of Kerma, especially during the Second Intermediate Period when the Kermans threatened the southern borders of Egypt.</p>\n<p>Recent survey and excavation work has identified many new sites south of Kerma, many located on channels of the Nile, now dry, which lay to the east of the modern course of the river. This pattern of settlement indicates a substantial population and for the first time provides us with some sort of context in which we can place Kerma itself. Survey work in advance of the Merowe Dam at the Fourth Cataract has confirmed the presence of Kerma sites at least as far upriver as the Abu Hamad/Mograt Island area.</p>\n<p>Kerma was evidently a sizable political entity - Egyptian records speak of its rich and populous agricultural regions. Unlike Egypt, Kerma seems to have been highly centralized. It controlled the 1st to 4th Cataracts, which meant its domain was as extensive as ancient Egypt.</p>\n<p>Numerous village communities scattered alongside fields of crops made up the bulk of the realm, but there also seems to have been districts wherein pastoralism (goat, sheep and cattle) and gold processing were important industries. Certain Kerma towns served to centralize agricultural products and direct trade. Analysis of the skulls of thousands of cattle interred in royal Kerma tombs suggest that stock were sometimes brought vast distances, from far districts, presumably as a type of tribute from rural communities on the death of Kerma's monarchs. This parallels the importance of cattle as royal property in other parts of Africa at later times.</p>\n<p>Read more: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerma_culture\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerma_culture</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"kerma-kngdm"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kerma kingdom","img":[{"name":"kerma-kngdm_city.jpg","desc":"Excavations at Kerma."},{"name":"kerma-kngdm-4.jpg","desc":"Ancient Kerma bowl kept at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. \"Bowl with Running-Spiral Decoration\""},{"name":"kerma-kngdm_van_Kerma.jpg","desc":"Statues of pharaohs of the Nubian Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt discovered near Kerma and exposed in the Kerma Museum"},{"name":"kerma-kngdm_Deffufa_Kerma.jpg","desc":"The Western Deffufa"},{"name":"kerma-kngdm_The-Eastern-Deffufa.jpg","desc":"The Eastern Deffufa"},{"name":"kerma-kngdm_Eastern-Deffufa7.jpg","desc":"Eastern Deffufa"},{"name":"kerma-kngdm_Deffufa9.jpg","desc":"Western Deffufa in ancient city Kerma, Nubia, Sudan"},{"name":"","desc":""},{"name":"","desc":""},{"name":"","desc":""},{"name":"","desc":""}],"vid":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wjA3nasdLgA"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/njCa1rdjw6I"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pdguPbKwJnQ"}],"url":[{"id":1,"url":"https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/KingdomOfKush_StudentsWorksheets.pdf","title":"The wealth of Africa.
