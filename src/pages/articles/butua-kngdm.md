The Kingdom of Butua or Butwa (c. 1450 - 1683) was a pre-colonial African state located in what is now southwestern Zimbabwe. It arose from the collapse of Great Zimbabwe in the sixteenth and seventeenth century. Butua was renowned as the source of gold for Arab and Portuguese traders. The region was first mentioned in Portuguese records in 1512.
 
The kingdom was governed by the Torwa dynasty of the BakaLanga people until 1683. The ruling dynasty based its capital at the stone city of Khami. Its people were ancestors of the Bakalanga. In 1683, the kingdom was conquered by the Rozwi Empire.

The BakaLanga  at Khami developed both the stone building techniques and the pottery styles found at Great Zimbabwe. Masons continued to refine Great Zimbabweâ€™s tradition of building precise stone walls. The BakaLanga are thought to have built Khami, Lusvingo, Mapungugwe and other ruins scattered across western Zimbabwe and east Botswana. 

Several artefacts such as ritual drinking pots, iron and bronze weapons, copper objects and ivory divining pieces are also found at Khami.
