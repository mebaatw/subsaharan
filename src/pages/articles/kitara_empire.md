The Empire of Kitara (Empire of Light), also known as Bunyoro-Kitara, refers specifically to the Kingdom of the Bakitara at the time of its greatest expansion, which had rulership that stretched throughout the Nile valley and beyond. The Chwezi Empire had fragmented into various autonomous states towards the 1300s. The Kitara Empire included what corresponds to modern Uganda, northern Tanzania, eastern Congo (DRC), Rwanda,Burundi, Zambia and Malawi.
