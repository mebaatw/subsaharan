The Kingdom of Orungu (c. 1700–1927) (Portuguese: Reino da Orungu, French: Royaume d'Orungu) was a small, pre-colonial state of what is now Gabon in Central Africa. Through its control of the slave trade in the 18th and 19th centuries, it was able to become the most powerful of the trading centers that developed in Gabon during that period.
