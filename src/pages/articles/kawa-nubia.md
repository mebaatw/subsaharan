Kawa is a site in Sudan, located between the Third and Fourth Cataracts of the Nile on the east bank of the river, across from Dongola. In ancient times it was the site of several temples to the Egyptian god Amun, built by the Egyptian rulers Amenhotep III and Tutankhamun, and by Taharqa and other Kushite kings.

At least three Ancient Egyptian granitic gneiss statues of Amun in the form of a ram protecting King Taharqa were displayed at the Temple of Amun at Kawa in Nubia. Construction of the stone temple was started in 683 BC by the pharaoh Taharqa. The ram is one of the animals sacred to Amun, and several temples dedicated to Amun, including the one at Karnak featured ram or ram-headed sphinx statues.

The rams were found by Professor Francis Llewellyn Griffith during his excavations at the temple in 1930-1. Two sets of paired sandstone bases, in front of the first and second pylons respectively, were found at the western approach to the stone temple, and figures of rams were found on two of them. The pairing ram to the one at the British Museum is held at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, where many of the artefacts from the excavations at Kawa are held. The British Museum's example was acquired in 1933 from Professor Griffith's Oxford Excavations in Nubia.

Anlamani is particularly well known from a stela discovered in a temple at Kawa. Anlamani was a king of Nubia or Kush who ruled from 620 BC and died around 600 BC. Under his reign, Kush experienced a revival in its power. 

Two granite statues of this king have been found in Jebel Barkal while a block from Meroë bearing his name is known. One of the statues is today located in the National Museum of Khartoum, Sudan) while the other (a 12 foot high statue) is in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Anlamani was buried in pyramid Nu. 6 in Nuri. In his tomb stood a large chamber, decorated with religious texts, and his sarcophagus.
