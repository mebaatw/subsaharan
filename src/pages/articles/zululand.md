The Kingdom of Zulu , sometimes referred to as the Zulu Empire or the Kingdom of Zululand, was a monarchy in Southern Africa that extended along the coast of the Indian Ocean from the Tugela River in the south to Pongola River in the north.

The kingdom grew to dominate much of what is today KwaZulu-Natal and Southern Africa. In 1879, the British Empire invaded, beginning the Anglo-Zulu War. After an initial Zulu victory at the Battle of Isandlwana in January, the British Army would regroup and eventually defeated the Zulus in July in the Battle of Ulundi. The area was subsequently absorbed into the Colony of Natal and later became part of the Union of South Africa.
