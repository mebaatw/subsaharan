The research has revealed that this period started around the beginning of our era. It is characterised by the arrival of iron-using human groups bringing in a new pottery tradition and a diversified subsistence economy, presumably mainly based on the cultivation of plants, particularly sorghum. In part, they lived in extremely large, densely populated and, probably, fortied settlements, comparable to 16th – 20th century AD regional centres known from south of the lake. The paper presents the data collected at each of the sites studied and discusses the significance of the new evidence in a regional and supraregional context.' }

The Sao civilisation flourished in Central Africa from the sixth century BC to as late as the sixteenth century AD after which the Sao were absorbed into the Bornu Empire. The Sao lived by the Chari River Around Lake Chad in territory that later became part of Cameroon and Chad. They were made up of several patrilineal clans who were united into a single polity. The polity were organized into ranked and centralized societies. 

Sao artifacts show that they were skilled workers in bronze, copper, and iron. Finds include bronze sculptures and terra cotta statues of human and animal figures, coins, funerary urns, household utensils, jewelry, highly decorated pottery, spears,  well-fired ceramic vessels, and fine personal ornaments in clay, copper, iron, alloyed copper and brass.

The Sao were recorded to have dwelt in small towns that were protected by moats and earthen ramparts, suggesting that they may have functioned as city-states.

Archaeological evidence shows that the Sao buried their dead. The tradition of placing a corpse in the fetal position inside of an earthenware jar was in practice from the 12-13th centuries AD.
 
Today, several ethnic groups of Nigeria, northern Cameroon and southern Chad, but particularly the Sara, Kotoko, claim descent from the civilization of the Sao.
