The Gwisho hot-springs is located in Lochinvar National Park, Zambia. Radiocarbon dates place human activity in the area between 2750 and 2340 BCE. The people of Gwisho developed a bone industry, which produced items such as awls, ornaments and composite arrows. They also constructed and utilized wooden tools to uproot edible roots, which was a staple in their diet. Most of their food supply came from harvesting edible matter.

Radiocarbon dates place human activity in the area between 2750 and 2340 BCE. 

Remains were found that seems to have been a hut or windbreak as well as sticks and twigs and a mass of grass lay in a flattened heap. All the grass and wood had been stripped of their roots. Tiny fragments of fired clay excavated from the site may have been used for windbreaks to smear huts and other structures. Blades and bladelets were excavated with primary flakes. Microlith and macrolith industries were discovered in the area as well as wooden tools.

Large numbers of fragmentary bones had been excavated from the Gwisho sites. The bones were well preserved, with fresh edges and spongy structures. The remains belong to buffalo, lechwe, wildebeest, impala, buchduck, kudu, eland, oribi roan, hartebeest, grysbuck, duiker, zebra, warthog, bushpig, elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, monkey, baboon, birds, tortoise. None of these animal findings are surprises since all the species are, or were common in the area of Gwisho. Ivory and fresh-water shells were found along with shell beads.

Wooden artifacts and fibers were preserved under favorable conditions. Types of wood include Baikiaea, Dalbergia, Brachystegia, and Celtis. The hunters of Gwisho had at least three vegetation zones near their camps.

The hunting methods of the Gwishoâ€™s hunters were probably similar to those used by modern San. Many arrowheads and link shafts were excavated from the site, indicating the use of the bow and arrow. They also used spears as a hunting tool. Another method employed by the Gwisho inhabitants was the use of snares and traps. 

At the Gwisho site of Kafue Flats, more than thirty burials were found and skeletons showed Khoisan features. In terms of morphology, the Gwisho people may have been physically divergent from modern San.
