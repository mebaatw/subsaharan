Hundreds of them are to be found in the borderland between Cameroon and Central African Republic. They are thought to be memorials, but contain no human remains, and were made by cultivators during the first millennium BCE. That they had the energy and resources to cut, transport and erect stones so large that they posed a danger to modern excavators shows the strength the religious or other beliefs which inspired them. It also reflects a culture which could afford this type of extravagance” - Elizabeth Allo Isichei – 1997. A History of African Societies to 1870.' },

Bouar is a market town in the western Central African Republic.

The Bouar Megaliths in the western region of the country indicate an advanced level of habitation dating back to the very late Neolithic Era (c. 3500-2700 BC). About seventy groups of megaliths lie in the town and to its north and east. The Bouar Megaliths were added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on April 11, 2006 in the Cultural category.
