Sudano-Sahelian architecture refers to a range of similar indigenous architectural styles common to the African peoples of the Sahel and Sudanian grassland (geographical) regions of West Africa, south of the Sahara, but north of the fertile forest regions of the coast.

This style is characterized by the use of mudbricks and adobe plaster, with large wooden-log support beams that jut out from the wall face for large buildings such as mosques or palaces. These beams also act as scaffolding for reworking, which is done at regular intervals, and involves the local community. The earliest examples of Sudano-Sahelian style probably come from Jenné-Jeno around 250 BC, where the first evidence of permanent mudbrick architecture in the region is found.[1]

<br/>
<h3>Difference between Savannah and Sahelian styles</h3>
<hr/>

The earthen architecture in the Sahel zone region is noticeably different from the building style in the neighboring savannah. The "old Sudanese" cultivators of the savannah built their compounds out of several cone-roofed houses. This was primarily an urban building style, associated with centres of trade and wealth, characterised by cubic buildings with terraced roofs comprise the typical style.

They lend a characteristic appearance to the close-built villages and cities. Large buildings such as mosques, representative residential and youth houses stand out in the distance. They are landmarks in a flat landscape that point to a complex society of farmers, craftsmen and merchants with a religious and political upper class.

With the expansion of Sahelian kingdoms south to the rural areas in the savannas (inhabited by culturally or ethnically similar groups to those in the Sahel), the Sudano-Sahelian style was reserved for mosques, palaces, the houses of nobility or townsfolk (as is evident in the Gur-Voltaic style), whereas among commonfolk, there was a mix between either typically distinct Sudano-Sahelian styles for wealthier families, and older African roundhut styles for rural villages and family compounds.

<br/>
<h3>Substyles</h3>
<hr/>

The Sudano-Sahelian architectural style itself can be broken down into four smaller sub-styles that are typical of different ethnic groups in the region. The examples used here illustrate the construction of mosques as well as palaces, as the architectural style is concentrated around inland Muslim populations.

As with the people, many of these styles cross-pollinate and produce buildings with shared features. Any one of these styles is not exclusive to one particular modern countries borders, but are linked to the ethnicity of its builders or surrounding populations. For example, a Malian migrant community in traditionally Gur area may build in the style characteristic of their ancestral homeland, while neighbouring Gur buildings are built in the local style. These styles include: 

<h3>Malian Architecture</h3>

The architecture of Mali comprises adobe buildings such as <a href="/Djenne-Djenno/">The Great Mosque of Djenne</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Timbuktu">University of Timbuktu</a>. It can be found all over the Sahel region. Malian architecture developed during the <a href="/ghana-empire">Ghana Empire</a> which founded most of Mali's great cities. They then flourished in West Africa's two greatest civilisations the <a href="/mali_empire">Mali Empire</a> and the <a href="/songhai">Songhai Empire</a>.

<a href="/timbuktu-city">Timbuktu</a> has many adobe and mud brick buildings but the most famous is the University. The masajids (mosques) of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankore_Madrasah">Sankore</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djinguereber_Mosque">Djinguereber</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kani-Kombole">Kani-Kombole Mosque</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidi_Yahya_Mosque">Sidi Yahya</a> were the centres of learning in medieval <a href="/mali_empire">Mali</a> and produced some of the most famous works in Africa, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbuktu_Manuscripts">Timbuktu Manuscripts</a>.
    
<br/>    
<h3>Fortress style</h3>

Fortress style is predominantly used by the Zarma peoples of northern Nigeria and Niger, Hausa-Fulani, Tuareg and Arab mixed communities in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agadez">Agadez</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanuri_people">Kanuri</a> people of Lake Chad, and <a href="/songhai">Songhai</a> of northeastern Mali. Military aspect to construction of high protective compound walls built around a central courtyard. Minaret is the only structure with support beams showing. Characterized by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankore_Madrasah">Sankore Mosque</a> of Timbuktu, the tomb of Askia in <a href="/gao_empire">Gao</a> Mali, and the Agadez mosque of northern Niger.

<br/>
<h3> Hausa Architecture </h3>

Hausa architecture (known as Tubali in the Hausa language) is a distinct sub-style among the various Sudano-Sahelian architectural styles predominant in North and Northwestern Nigeria, Niger, Eastern Burkina Faso, Northern Benin, and found throughout the Sahel-geographic band stretching from Senegal and Mauritania in the West to Sudan in the east.

Hausa buildings are characterized by the use of dry mud bricks in cubic structures, multi-storied buildings for the social elite, the use of parapets related to their military/fortress building past, and traditional white stucco and plaster for house fronts. At times the facades may be decorated with various abstract relief designs, sometimes painted in vivid colours to convey information about the occupant.

Examples include the architecture of the <a href="https://www.akdn.org/architecture/project/yaama-mosque">Yamma Mosque</a> and old town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinder">Zinder</a>, The Hausa quarter of Agadez Niger, the Gidan Rumfa of <a href="/kano-state">Kano</a>, and various Hausa districts across West Africa.

<br/>
<h3> Volta basin</h3>

Volta basin of the Gur and Manden groups of Burkina Faso, northern Ghana and northern Cote d'Ivoire. The most conservative of the three styles. A single courtyard, characterized by high white and black painted walls, inward curved turrets supporting an exterior wall, and a larger turret nearer the center. Characterized by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larabanga">Larabanga</a> mosque of Ghana and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobo-Dioulasso">Bobo-Dioulasso</a> Grand Mosque.

<br/>
<h3>Sudano-Sahelian Styles by Region</h3>
<hr/>

At <a href="/koumbi-saleh">Kumbi Saleh</a>, locals lived in dome-shaped dwellings in the king's section of the city, surrounded by a great enclosure. Traders lived in stone houses in a section which possessed 12 beautiful mosques (as described by al-Bakri), one of which was for Friday prayer.[16] The king is said to have owned several mansions, one of which was sixty-six feet long and forty-two feet wide, contained seven rooms, was two stories high, and had a staircase, with paintings on the walls and chambers filled with sculpture.

Sahelian architecture initially grew from the two cities of Djenné and Timbuktu. The Sankore Mosque, constructed from mud on timber, was similar in style to the Great Mosque of Djenné.

<a href="/ashanti">Ashanti</a> architecture from Ghana is perhaps best known from the reconstruction at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumasi">Kumasi</a>. Its key features are courtyard-based buildings, and walls with striking reliefs in brightly painted mud plaster. An example of a shrine can be seen at Bawjiase in Ghana. Four rectangular rooms, constructed from wattle and daub, lie around a courtyard. Animal designs mark the walls, and palm leaves cut to a tiered shape provide the roof.
